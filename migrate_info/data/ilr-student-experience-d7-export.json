You need to say a lot about yourself very concisely, and your résumé must be appealing to the eye and error-free. Employers assess résumés in under 30 seconds. You want to be sure to stand out from the crowd for the right reasons!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Cover Letters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cover letters introduce you to prospective employers and motivate them to read your résumé and learn more about your background and qualifications. These include <strong>letters of application,</strong> when you know of an opening and are writing to apply for it, and <strong>letters of inquiry,</strong> when you don't know if an opening exists but you want to explore employment possibilities with an organization. Your cover letters, like your résumé, must be well written and contain no errors. The letters should add to the information that is presented in your <strong>résumé, not just repeat it.</strong> You want to catch the reader's attention with your writing style, attention to detail, and statement of how your qualifications match the job requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where to begin</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/resources/downloads.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Career Guide</a>, published by Cornell Career Services, has information on how to develop a résumé and cover letter and includes helpful samples of both documents. The Career Guide is available online, or you can pick up a hard copy in 201 Ives or in Barnes Hall. After you've used the resources available to develop your own résumé and cover letter, the staff, and peer advisors in ILR OCS, are available to review rough drafts of your cover letters. Stop by the ILR Office of Career Services or call (607) 255-7816 during drop-in times or to schedule an appointment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://cornell.optimalresume.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Optimal Resume</a> is an additional tool offered by Cornell Career Services to help create your résumé step-by-step. Choose from many different&nbsp;résumé styles, and change the look of an existing&nbsp;résumé with just a few clicks. We find this tool to be great to create a resume for the first time. However, once you find a format you like, consider copying it into a word doc and updating as needed.</p>\r\n",

You should familiarize yourself with the different types of interviews that employers use. The interview styles we hear about most frequently from students are <strong>screening</strong>, <strong>behavioral</strong>, and <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/story/interviewing/caseinterview.cfm\"><strong>case</strong></a>. Try to learn which type of interview you're scheduled to have so that you can be ready for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To increase your effectiveness in your job interviews, you should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"bulleted\">\r\n\t<li><strong>Prepare</strong> for the interview: Obtain a detailed job description and review it carefully; research the organization; and understand how you fill the needs of the position and the employer. There are many resources available online through the <a href=\"http://guides.library.cornell.edu/careers\">Cornell University Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://johnson.library.cornell.edu/\">Johnson School Management Library</a> as well as hardcopy materials in the Career Services Library in 103 Barnes Hall.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Practice</strong> interview techniques: Work on your communication skills; become used to talking about yourself, and come to OCS for a practice interview.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Perform</strong> in the interview: Your primary task is to convince the interviewer that you can meet the employer's needs and goals. Try to relax and smile, but maintain a professional demeanor. Demonstrate your enthusiasm and self-confidence. Don't do all the talking and don't be afraid of periods of silence; watch for cues that the interviewer is still with you. Additional tips on interviewing are available through our office.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Follow-up</strong>: After the interview, send a short letter of appreciation or a thank you email for the interviewer's time. In this letter you can emphasize any points about your qualifications that you might not have covered sufficiently or that you think are especially important and communicate your continuing interest in the company.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Before any interview, know your responses to the following questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"bulleted\">\r\n\t<li>\"Why are you interested in this position?\"</li>\r\n\t<li>\"What experience(s) do you think make you a strong candidate?\"</li>\r\n\t<li>\"How does this position fit into your overall career path?\"</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Do you have any questions for us?\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Practice Interview Program</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to help you prepare fully for your on-campus and off-campus interviews, the ILR Office of Career Services provides a practice interview program. This program offers practice or mock interviews with a trained volunteer or one of our staff members. You and the interviewer will spend 45 minutes role-playing an interview and going over feedback. This helps you learn what adjustments you need to make in your interview style. <strong>Practice Interviews are REQUIRED of all ILR students who will be utilizing On Campus Recruiting through ILR </strong>and must be completed before any scheduled on-campus interviews. Please note this does not include interview schedules in Barnes Hall but it is strongly encouraged that you complete a practice interview to best prepare for your career field of interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity to improve your interview performance. You will often find that this program also helps reduce your level of nervousness before the \"real\" interview with an employer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sign up for a practice interview time in 201 Ives Hall at least 48 hours in advance of an upcoming interview. You may dress for the interview as you would for the real thing or in your everyday clothes, whichever you prefer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Practice Interviewing Online</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://cornell.optimalresume.com/\">Optimal Interview</a> offers a way to practice right from your apartment or residence hall. Optimal Interview is part of Optimal Résumé, so you will sign in via Optimal Résumé (click New User in the top right corner to create your login and password). Follow these steps after logging in:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Choose Create New Interview from the Interviews module on the right.</li>\r\n\t<li>Name the interview (only you will see it).</li>\r\n\t<li>You will come to a screen with Select Interview Type on the left. Near the bottom of the list, there are three Practice Interview Questions (sets 1-3).</li>\r\n\t<li>Choose one of these sets.</li>\r\n\t<li>You may do all 20 questions by selecting your preferred format on the right. Alternatively, you may select specific questions you wish to answer, and then choose your format.</li>\r\n\t<li>Click Continue Interview at the bottom of the screen to go to the next step where you can see the questions and the suggestions by the online coach.</li>\r\n\t<li>There is a Review Center menu option along the top of your Interview to share the recorded interview with Cornell Career Services. Please do not select that option. They are not currently reviewing them. You may, however, come to ILR OCS drop-ins (M-F, 11am-2pm) to ask for feedback on one or two answers if needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

A GPA of 3.5, prior research with an ILR faculty member (e.g. senior honors thesis), and strong support of an ILR faculty member who agrees to act as the Special Committee Chair and supervise the completion of the M.S. thesis is required. As with all Cornell graduate degrees, the M.S. candidate's Special Committee sets degree requirements and verifies their completion.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>The Committee consists of two members of the Faculty whose research interests are related to those of the candidate. The Committee Chairperson works with the candidate closely, and a minor member represents a secondary concentration. The committee directs the research and conducts the thesis examination/defense, which is the final stage of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Applicants must submit a complete (on-line) Cornell Graduate Application (and application fee), a statement of purpose, full transcripts from all institutions attended, GRE or GMAT Test scores and a minimum of 2 academic letters of recommendation.

The 5th year features the thesis research, writing, and defense of the thesis. (In some cases the research, etc. will require more than one year to complete.) Other considerations include the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Students must maintain a strong academic average (GPA of 3.5) as evidence of ability to work at the Masters level.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Applicants must take the GRE or GMAT no later than November of their senior year to have scores available for inclusion in the graduate application. (Deadline December 15th)</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Applicants should have a research topic in mind and initiate contact with ILR Faculty members who might serve on the Special Graduate Committee and support the application.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Students will select a FEX opportunity based on interest and accessiblity. After selecting an opportunity, the student will contact the sponsor to set up a mutually convenient date to complete the FEX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I offer a FEX opportunity for more than one day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure. You should discuss with the student a mutually agreeable time and duration when the student contacts you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will I be notified if a student selects me as a FEX sponsor?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once students have selected their FEX positions, they will be given the contact information of their hosts. You should expect to hear from your extern in early December. In the event that your FEX opportunity is not selected by a student, you will also be notified during this time. We will help to find a student for your FEX opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WISP FAQ for Sponsors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If your question is not answered here, please feel free to contact us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are the dates for WISP flexible?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. The WISP period runs over the winter break for students, which is mid-December through mid-January. Internships are typically two to three weeks in length, but the specific dates are flexible. Specific dates and timeline for WISP for a given season will be available in late September or October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if I want to reimburse travel expenses or pay the student?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organizations providing monetary compensation or travel reimbursement to WISP students have the option to prescreen and select their intern(s). If you choose to pursue this option, it is critical that this be arranged well in advance with the WISP Coordinator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the WISP selection process work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, for both WISP and FEX, students select their internship/externship from the pool of available opportunities through a lottery ranking process in mid-November. The only restriction placed upon students in their selection is that they must meet the minimum qualifications stated on the registration form by the employer. The one exception to this process is in the case of paid WISPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the WISP lottery work?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WISP lottery is the process by which the majority of students are matched with their WISP internships. It is a unique placement method, in that a student has the opportunity to choose the employer rather than the other way around. This is intended to level the playing field for all participants, regardless of previous experience, and allow everyone equal opportunity to explore various career options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A randomly assigned lottery time allows students to select their employer of choice. On the day of the lottery, students come in to the office with a list of top preferences and choose from all the remaining available opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will I be notified if a student selects my project for their WISP?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once students have selected their WISP positions, they will be given the contact information for their sponsor. You should expect to hear from your intern in early December. You will also receive your WISP student's resume and contact information. We will also notify you in the event that your WISP opportunity is not selected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contact Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may reach the FEX and WISP Assistants at (607) 255-0836 or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:ilrfex@cornell.edu\">ilrfex@cornell.edu</a> / <a href=\"mailto:ilrwisp@cornell.edu\">ilrwisp@cornell.edu</a>.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h2>What makes ILR unique?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the only institution of higher education in the United States to offer an undergraduate degree in the interdisciplinary field of workplace studies. ILR's curriculum spans six academic departments and encompasses the interdisciplinary, social sciences-based field of workplace studies. ILR undergraduate students are leaders and self-starters, and our advanced degree programs are the best in the world. At ILR, you recruit from a diverse group of approximately 1000 undergraduates and 250 graduate students to be future leaders in your workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR prides itself on the ethnic, racial and geographic diversity of its students and is responsive to the social, academic, and cultural needs of students from diverse backgrounds. ILR students hail from all corners of the country and world. For information on current class year demographics, please contact our Director, Anu Lyons, at (607) 255-7816.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/degree-programs/undergraduate-degree-programs\">View specific information about the BSILR curriculum.</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/degree-programs/graduate-degree-programs\">View more information about our graduate degree programs and curriculum.</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recruit Current Students</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employers interested in hiring ILR students </strong>are expected to adhere to Cornell Career Service's <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/employers/hiring_students/recruiting/policies.cfm\">recruiting policies</a>&nbsp; for internship/full-time recruiting, and can recruit in the following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Summer Internships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many employers ask if they are legally required to pay students enrolled in an internship. The answer to that question depends on whether or not the student is considered an employee subject to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA requires employers to pay all employees at the rate of not less than current minimum wage. The Department of Labor (DOL) has developed criteria to assist employers in identifying when a student is&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;considered an employee within the meaning of the FLSA:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocation school.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The training is for the benefit of the trainees or students.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The trainees or students do not displace regular employees, but work under their close observation.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees or students, and on occasion the employer's operations may actually be impeded.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The trainees or students are not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the training period.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>The employer and the trainees or students understand that the trainees or students are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>A student not meeting all of the above criteria will in fact be considered an employee covered by the FLSA and therefore the employer is legally obligated to provide compensation for his or her services. As with all matters requiring legal interpretation, it is always wise for employers to work closely with their own legal department to ensure compliance with federal and applicable state laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On-Campus Recruiting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR Office of Career Services hosts an active on-campus recruiting program managed through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cornell.joinhandshake.com/login\">Handshake</a>. Employers find on-campus visits to be a very effective way to identify prospective summer interns and full-time hires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fall 2018 calendar runs from September 12 to November 30.

It is a one-day shadowing program during winter break that provides an invaluable opportunity for students to explore diverse ILR-related career fields, gain firsthand work exposure, and network with alumni.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>FEX opportunities are typically offered in a variety of fields and organizations, including corporate human resources, labor relations, labor, government, law, arbitration/third-party, non-profits, consulting, and financial services.</li>\r\n\t<li>Students must attend an information session and register to participate.</li>\r\n\t<li>Opportunities are selected through a random lottery in mid-November.&nbsp; Specific instructions will be shared with registered students.</li>\r\n\t<li>Participants are responsible for their own housing and transportation to and from the FEX opportunity.\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Thus, students are encouraged to choose a FEX opportunity in or near their hometowns or where they have family/friends with whom to stay.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Specific opportunities vary from year to year, though many sponsors participate annually.&nbsp; Visit <a href=\"/node/17886\">past sponsors</a> to see a sample of prior sponsors.\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>We encourage you to review the locations and career fields from last year. Although we add sponsors each year, they are generally in the same geographic regions; if you do not see your hometown listed, please meet with a career advisor to discuss how to go about setting up an independent FEX.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STUDENT DEADLINES are usually in late September - early October. </strong>To participate, students must attend an information session; check your emails for details regarding when and where they will be offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EMPLOYERS:</strong> To become a sponsor, please fill out the <a href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/special-study-options/internships/fex-wisp-sponsor-registration\">sponsorship form</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do I apply?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in FEX, you must complete two steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Attend the required info session, which occurs early in September.*</li>\r\n\t<li>Register and submit your résumé through the <a href=\"/node/265596\">online application</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>*Important deadlines will be covered at the required info session. Failure to comply with these deadlines may compromise your eligibility to participate in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the FEX lottery, and how does it work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The FEX lottery functions much like the campus housing lottery and is the way most participants obtain an opportunity (some students set up an independent FEX; see the next question). The process will be explained via email to registered students. Briefly, you will be randomly assigned a lottery time several days before the lottery. Prior to the lottery day, you should review all available positions listed on the FEX website and develop a list of your top three or four FEX choices. On the day of the lottery, you will come to the office at your designated time with your list and select a FEX from the remaining opportunities. <strong>Once you have selected a FEX in the lottery, you are obligated to complete that externship.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lottery times are non-transferable and non-changeable. If you absolutely cannot be present, you may authorize someone (including the FEX coordinator) to act on your behalf (<strong>please do not leave class or an exam to participate</strong>). To designate someone else, you must contact the FEX coordinator prior to the lottery day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>There are no FEX opportunities posted for my geographic area. Can I still participate?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Absolutely. Though there has been a concerted effort by OCS in recent years to expand our geographic base of available FEX opportunities, there are still students who come from areas where shadowing opportunities are traditionally scarce. &nbsp;In these cases, it is possible to work with a career advisor in OCS to conduct an independent search. This will require a bit of extra work on your part, but is well worth the effort. If you are interested in pursuing this option, it is very important that you contact OCS as soon as possible to get started. The earlier you begin your search, the better your chances of securing a FEX in your preferred geographic area and career field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>May I complete more than one externship opportunity?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. After all lottery participants have had a chance to choose a FEX, the remaining options are reposted and can be selected by a FEX student who has already secured one FEX. Thereafter, other ILR first-year students (who didn’t register for FEX) are considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if my plans change?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect all students to honor their FEX commitments.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>The <strong>Winter Intersession Program</strong> (<strong>WISP</strong>) is designed specifically for ILR students and provides an opportunity for sophomores, juniors, seniors, and first-year MILRs to develop on-the-job experience through a short-term assignment with a project sponsor over winter break. Opportunities typically last two to three weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>WISP opportunities are typically offered in a variety of fields and organizations across the country, including corporate human resources, labor relations, labor, government, law, arbitration/third-party, nonprofits, consulting, and financial services.</li>\r\n\t<li>Students must attend an information session and register to participate.</li>\r\n\t<li>Participants are responsible for their own housing and transportation to and from the WISP opportunity.\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>Thus, students are encouraged to choose a WISP opportunity in or near their hometowns or where they have family/friends with whom to stay.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>There are two types of opportunities:\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>Paid WISPs are posted on Cornell Handshake, and students apply for them as they would any internship or job. Sponsors select WISP interns through phone or video interviews. Specific instructions are sent to registered students.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Unpaid opportunities are posted on the ILR Office of Career Services website. Students select the opportunity through a random lottery in mid-November. Specific instructions are sent to registered students.\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Unpaid opportunities allow students to select a project rather than go through a screening process by the sponsor. This enables a student with relatively little formal employment history to gain valuable experience and to prove his or her abilities on-the-job.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sponsors who offer unpaid opportunities must ensure they&nbsp;meet the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm\">six federal guidelines set by the FLSA</a>.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Specific opportunities vary from year to year, though many sponsors participate annually. Visit <a href=\"/node/17896\">past sponsors</a> to see a sample list of past sponsors.\r\n\t\t<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\r\n\t\t\t<li>We encourage you to review the locations and career fields from last year. Although we add sponsors each year, they are generally in the same geographic regions; if you do not see your hometown listed, please meet with a career advisor to learn about how to go about setting up an independent WISP.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STUDENT DEADLINES are typically in mid-to-late September. </strong>To participate, students must attend an information session which are typically announced through email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EMPLOYERS:</strong> To become a sponsor, please fill out the <a href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/special-study-options/internships/fex-wisp-sponsor-registration\">sponsorship form</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do I apply?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in WISP, you must complete two steps:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Attend the required info session, which occurs early in September.*</li>\r\n\t<li>Register and submit your résumé through the <a href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/student-experience/credit-and-non-credit-internships/winter-intersession-program-wisp/wisp-student-application\">online application</a><a href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/student-experience/credit-and-non-credit-internships/freshman-externship-program-fex/fex-student-application\">.</a></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>*Important deadlines will be covered at the required info session. Failure to comply with these deadlines may compromise your eligibility to participate in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the WISP lottery, and how does it work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The WISP lottery is the process by which most students obtain their WISP internships (some students set up an independent WISP; more information is below). The process will be explained via email to registered students. Briefly, it is a unique placement method, in that you, as a student, get to choose your sponsor, rather than the other way around. This is intended to level the playing field for all participants, regardless of previous experience, and allows everyone equal opportunity to explore various career options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lottery functions much like the campus housing lottery. You will be randomly assigned a lottery time. Prior to the lottery day, you should review all the available positions on the WISP website and develop a list of your top five or six WISP choices <strong>(you must meet the minimum qualifications for each, be available on the specified dates, AND have housing/transportation already secured)</strong>. On the day of the lottery, you will come to the office with your list and select a WISP from the remaining opportunities. <em>Once you have selected a WISP in the lottery, you are obligated to complete that internship.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lottery times are non-transferable and non-changeable. If you absolutely cannot be present, you may authorize someone (including the WISP coordinator) to act on your behalf (<strong>please do not leave class or an exam to participate</strong>). To designate someone else, you must contact the WISP coordinator prior to the lottery day.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How can I get a paid WISP?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A limited number of paid WISPs are available each year. For these, the sponsor has the option to select a particular student to fill the position through a résumé collection and often, an interview. All paid WISP opportunities will be posted on the WISP website and on Handshake. You will receive an email with instructions for applying for paid WISPs on Handshake in mid-October. It is your responsibility to check the page periodically and keep abreast of all available paid opportunities. Students will be notified if they have been selected for any of the paid WISPs prior to the WISP lottery in order that those students not selected may still choose an unpaid position. Sponsors who offer unpaid opportunities must ensure they&nbsp;meet the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm\">six federal guidelines set by the FLSA</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>There are no WISPs posted for my geographic area. Can I still participate?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Absolutely. Although we are always trying to expand our geographic base of available WISPs, there are students who come from areas where internships are traditionally scarce. In these cases, it is possible to work with a career advisor in OCS to arrange an independent WISP opportunity. This will require extra work on your part, but is well worth the effort. If you are interested in pursuing this option, it is very important that you meet with a career advisor as soon as possible to get started. The earlier you begin your search, the better your chances of securing a WISP in your preferred geographic area and career field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Are the dates for WISP flexible?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In many cases, yes. The WISP posting for each opportunity specifies the dates and whether or not they are flexible. Please play close attention to this. If the sponsor says they are not flexible, then you must not select that opportunity unless you are available for the <strong>entire</strong> listed time period—all day, every day. The standard WISP period runs from just after the fall semester is over until just before the spring semester begins, though not every opportunity begins in December. Please read the postings carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if my plans change?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect all students to honor their WISP commitments. It is expected that you will determine your availability prior to being selected for a paid WISP or choosing a WISP on lottery day. Be sure you talk with your family about the program to ensure you will have transportation available to you and to make sure they have not made other plans for you over winter break. In addition, if you are participating in fraternity or sorority recruitment, please check those dates and select opportunities that fit with your available time. <em>If an unforeseeable circumstance impacts your participation, please notify your sponsor and our office immediately.</em></p>\r\n",

In operation for nearly forty years, the ILR Credit Internship Program is widely recognized in the United States as the most successful of its type. The program was created by the faculty of the ILR School more than 40 years ago to afford our advanced undergraduates, juniors and seniors, opportunities to enhance their understanding of the field of industrial and labor relations by working for a semester (approximately 14 weeks), in one of the professional careers it encompasses. Students intern across the U.S. and around the world.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>For most of its history the ILR Credit Internship Program operated almost exclusively within the United States. In recent years, however, we have sought to expand its scope in attempt to offer our students unique opportunities to experience industrial and labor relations in an international setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have expanded our program to include great internships with the European Foundation on the Improvement of Living &amp; Working Conditions in Dublin, Ireland; the Employers' Forum on Disability, American Express, and the T&amp;G Union in London, England; the Congress of South African Trade Unions and the African Leadership Academy in South Africa, and the Solidarity Centre in a variety of offices around the world, among many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other great opportunities are in the planning stages for international locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are interested in pursuing an international credit internship, please review the information on this web site or contact the ILR Credit Internship Office at 607-255-2266 or stop by 119 Ives Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>International Housing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Locating suitable, inexpensive housing is usually a main concern of prospective interns, particularly those intending to intern in a large international city. Because the internship program is designed to simulate \"real life,\" finding suitable housing for the term of the internship (as well as meeting all of the other requirements of daily life) is the responsibility of each intern. Interns may, however, avail themselves of useful advice in this regard by consulting with the internship program's managing director and by finding out from current and former interns how they found suitable housing in the same internship location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those students pursuing international placements, housing is often your most difficult (and expensive), obstacle. Current and former interns are often the best source of information on inexpensive, convenient and safe accommodations. Students seeking international internships should begin their housing search early in the process. Internet resources and online newspapers (classified ads), are a good place to start. Please see the internship program's managing director for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The managing director will also provide students with as many housing resources as possible for particular cities. However, students should be proactive and persistent in their housing search. Housing opportunities often come and go quickly, so students need to be regularly engaged in their housing search. Students should also not hesitate to ask their internship supervisors for advice and suggestions on their housing search. Some good resources are:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>In Dublin:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://chubbproperties.com/\"><font color=\"#941e12\">ChubbProperties.com</font></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>In London:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.expatriates.com/\"><font color=\"#941e12\">expatriates.com</font></a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.foxtons.co.uk/let/cheap-flats-in-london.html\"><font color=\"#941e12\">Foxtons</font></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

This project focuses on class action lawsuits in which several plaintiffs represent a class of women or minorities. When these cases are settled or when the defendant has been found guilty of discrimination, remedies include diversity training for managers, special training programs for members of the class to be promoted, employment goals and timetables, special outreach efforts, etc.&nbsp; Similarly, with the passage of the ADA, as amended (ADA), which outlaws discrimination based on disability, this repository focuses on settlements and court decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR Title VII Consent Decree and ADA Cases Repositories are the only central repositories of resources of their kind for the legal community to help them make recommendations for provisions of consent degrees or court orders to remedy discrimination. No central database listing programs that have been used in the past and evaluating their effectiveness exists, which allows for analysis by industry, court, protected class, and/or theory of discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These databases are widely used throughout the world.&nbsp; On an average month, the Title VII repository has 1200-1500 downloads from 50 or more countries, and the ADA repository has 400-500 downloads from 30-40 countries.&nbsp; A possible project activity would be to analyze the cases that are most downloaded, in the United States and elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a paid, full-time fellowship in NYC beginning Monday, June 1, 2020 until early August 2020.&nbsp; Students are responsible for their housing accommodations in New York City.

This project focuses on class action lawsuits in which several plaintiffs represent a class of women or minorities. When these cases are settled or when the defendant has been found guilty of discrimination, remedies include diversity training for managers, special training programs for members of the class to be promoted, employment goals and timetables, special outreach efforts, etc.&nbsp; Similarly, with the passage of the ADA, as amended (ADA), which outlaws discrimination based on disability, this repository focuses on settlements and court decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR Title VII Consent Decree and ADA Cases Repositories are the only central repositories of resources of their kind for the legal community to help them make recommendations for provisions of consent degrees or court orders to remedy discrimination. No central database listing programs that have been used in the past and evaluating their effectiveness exists, which allows for analysis by industry, court, protected class, and/or theory of discrimination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These databases are widely used throughout the world.&nbsp; On an average month, the Title VII repository has 1200-1500 downloads from 50 or more countries, and the ADA repository has 400-500 downloads from 30-40 countries.&nbsp; A possible project activity would be to analyze the cases that are most downloaded, in the United States and elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a paid, full-time fellowship in NYC beginning Monday, June 1, 2020 until early August 2020.&nbsp; Students are responsible for their housing accommodations in New York City.

SVYM is a community development, non-religious, non-political organization working for the benefit of indigenous and rural people in southern India through effective education, accessible healthcare and sustainable empowerment initiatives. The organization boasts several academic initiatives, including a Master's degree in Developmental Studies offered through a local university as well as housing a grassroots policy research institute (GRAAM) in collaboration with the Cornell Institute of Public Affairs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, SVYM was named the #1 NGO in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with Cornell Global Health students, ILR students will participate in 2-weeks of courses at the Vivekananda Institute of Indian Studies to prepare for work in their service-learning placements. For more information about the courses of study, visit the <a href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/special-study-options/service-learning/india/courses-india-svym\">Courses page</a>. Students will then participate in 4 or 6-week service learning projects in SVYM project sites that are both interesting to the students and beneficial for the organization.&nbsp; This unique engaged-learning opportunity gives ILR students the chance to use their classroom learning and professional skills to collorate with SVYM to improve the community.&nbsp; This cross-cultural exchange &amp; learning and growth in global citixenship can be a life-changing and transformative experience for many students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Description of Project Component</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the initial 2-week learning component, students will be placed in either 4-week (ILR students) or 6-week (GH students) service projects at a SVYM project site. Projects will be selected during spring semester before going to India, and an attempt will be made to match the students' top choices and interests with the needs and desires of SVYM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is split into 2 parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 1. During the first week in India, students will take courses at the Vivekananda Institute of Indian Studies,&nbsp;an&nbsp;arm&nbsp;of&nbsp;SVYM,&nbsp;in Mysore, Karnataka state, India <a href=\"http://www.viis.in/\">(http://www.viis.in/)</a>. The courses are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Indian Civilization and Culture</li>\r\n\t<li>Gender in India</li>\r\n\t<li>Indian Labor&nbsp;Relations&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Economics or Global Health in the Indian Context (depending on program track)</li>\r\n\t<li>Kannada (official language of Karnataka)</li>\r\n\t<li>Elective course in yoga</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For the second, ILR students will assist in the a week-lomg debate workshop for 14-15 year old high school girls.&nbsp; The workshop will be lead by a member of the Cornell Speech and Debate Program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During week two, Global Health students will focus on health-related courses and go on field visits to hosptials and health centers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2. After 2 weeks of courses, students will take part in service projects at one of SVYM’s field sites in Mysore District. The service project sites will be determined during the spring semester, prior to the students’ departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sample of past projects offered by SVYM (note that the projects change year-to-year, depending on the needs of the communities):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ILR-focused projects</strong><em>: &nbsp; law &amp; alternative dispute resolution, organizational management, policy, governance, child labor, human resources management, corporate social responsibility, education policy, teaching English, palliative care, HIV study, finance and accounting, gender studies, disabilities studies, adaptive leadership project, marketing and fundraising.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Global Health-focused projects</strong>: <em>video production on self-administration of insulin and foot care, HIV-AIDs community project, palliative care, research and creation of standard procedures for Aruvedic (traditional) medicine,&nbsp; business plan for medicine production, educational material for yoga, assessment of patient flow,&nbsp; nutrition study, and designing labels for traditional medicines</em>.&nbsp; In addition to projects, on occasion, GH students may have the opportunity to shadow doctors in the field or the hospital setting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13.008000373840332px;\">View the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 13.008000373840332px;\">YouTube videos from past summers. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>View the 2019 India GSL video!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"106532\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"attributes\":{\"height\":360,\"width\":480,\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"7\"},\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"7\":{\"format\":\"default\"}}}]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>View the&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 13.008000373840332px;\">YouTube video from the 2016 India Program</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"69171\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"2016 ILR SVYM India Global Service Learning\",\"height\":360,\"width\":480,\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>View the YouTube video from the 2015 India Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;[[{\"fid\":\"53351\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"2015 ILR Cornell SVYM Global Service Learning\",\"height\":360,\"width\":480,\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]</p>\r\n",

Students will be responsible for airfare (ILR students will be eligible to apply for university funding and an ILR travel grant to cover the airfare and other costs), visa fees, immunizations, health insurance, United Healthcare Global emergency travel insurance, and personal travel costs not directly related to the program.<span>&nbsp; Please&nbsp;contact Donna Ramil <a href=\"mailto:dmr47@cornell.edu\">(dmr47@cornell.edu)</a>&nbsp;for specifics. </span></span><br>\r\n\t\t\t<br>\r\n\t\t\tFor Global Health&nbsp;students, the cost will be around $4,500-$5,000. This includes visa, airfare, tuition, room&nbsp;&amp; board and local transportation in India. Please&nbsp;contact Jeanne Moseley (<a href=\"mailto:jmm298@cornell.edu\">jmm298@cornell.edu</a>) for specifics.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Will my insurance work overseas?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Call your insurance provider to ask about their company policies about international travel coverage. Some insurance companies will extend coverage for international travel, but availability and type of coverage will vary based on the company. Keep in mind that some companies may require you to pay up-front for any medical services and will reimburse you for the cost upon your arrival back to the United States, so it is best to have a plan for how to access emergency funds just in case.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Cornell University's Office of Student Health Insurance can be contacted by phone (607) 255-6363 from Monday to Friday, 9:30am – 4:30pm, for information about additional travel insurance through the Student Health Insurance Plan.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>What is United Healthcare Global?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>UHC is a form of medical coverage and personal security that is employed only in emergency cases. This does not include basic healthcare coverage, but will provide any emergency medically necessary care (ex. severe trauma, medical repatriation) or evacuation if in-country safety deteriorates (ex. the government collapses).</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Cornell requires students to fly on the safest airlines, as ranked by MEDEX. This includes all airlines that are ranked as Class 1 (good) or Class 2 (adequate). For detailed information, follow the given instructions:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ol>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Using Firefox (this process does not work for Safari or Internet Explorer), go to <a href=\"http://www.international.cornell.edu/\">www.international.cornell.edu</a>. Ensure that pop-ups are enabled.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Click on Travel Resources.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Scroll down the page and select Emergencies Abroad.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Click on Access MEDEX Now.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Login using Cornell NetID and password.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Select Airline Insider from the menu on the left.</li>\r\n\t\t</ol>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>What can I wear?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Southern Indian culture is conservative compared to North American culture, and dressing appropriately is an important way to show respect and cultural sensitivity. If you will be living in a rural center (i.e. Saragur, Hosahalli or Kenchanahalli), it is especially important to wear traditional South Indian attire. It is recommended for women to purchase salwar kameez (a traditional 3-piece coordinating outfit) in India or to wear loose pants with a long top that is also loose with longer sleeves and a modest neckline (i.e. tunics). It is considered inappropriate for ankles to be visible and for necklines to be too revealing (this includes V-neck and scoop-neck tops). Men are recommended to bring khaki or lightweight pants (no shorts) and lightweight shirts with a button-down shirt for special occasions. Sandals are completely appropriate for both men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Where will I live?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>While taking classes in Mysore, students will live in SVYM's hostel in the KIADB Industrial Housing Area in Hebbal, Mysore. Accommodations are comfortable, with each student having their own room or sharing with another Cornell student. Each room has it's own bathroom with shower, western toilet and sink. All meals will be provided in the canteen located on the ground floor of the hostel.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>During the Service Learning portion of the trip, housing will vary based on location. Students with placements in:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Mysore will continue to live in SVYM's hostel.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Saragur will live in the residential wing of the Vivekananda Memorial Hospital-Saragur.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Kenchanahalli will live in provided housing within the Vivekananda Memorial Hospital-Kenchanahalli campus.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Hosahalli will live in provided housing within the school campus.</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Is the water safe to drink? Is the food safe to eat?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Filtered, clean water is available at each of SVYM's sites, and this is safe to drink. Be cautious with tap water, though, even at an SVYM site. When eating in restaurants, only drink the water if it came from a sealed bottle of water – never drink the water if you are unsure if it came from the tap or a previously used water bottle.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>All food prepared in SVYM facilities is safe to eat. When eating in restaurants, avoid foods that are raw (i.e. salads, fresh fruit) in case they have been washed with unsafe water. It is good practice to avoid eating street food.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>How will I be able to communicate with my family and friends while I'm in India?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Students will be able to purchase pre-paid cell phones in Mysore, and if enough credit is placed on the phone, phone calls may be made to countries outside of India. (These phones are also beneficial for students to communicate with one another while in India and at their respective project sites.) However, students living in Mysore, Saragur and Hyderabad will have reliable access to the Internet and will be able to communicate home via email and Skype. Kenchanahalli has Internet access, but it is not as reliable during monsoon season. Hosahalli has very limited Internet access.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>I am a junior who will be studying abroad spring semester. Will I still be able to participate in the India SVYM GSL program this summer?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>All students who are going to India through the India SVYM GSL program are required to complete&nbsp;an&nbsp;ILR pre-departure course, a two-credit graded course designed to prepare students for their field experiences in India. This course will cover important topics including preparation for life abroad, appreciating cultural diversity, health and safety, gender issues, politics and issues surrounding development work.<br>\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;<br>\r\n\t\t\tDetails about the course will be shared with students who are selected into the GSL program. As of now, students who are unable to complete this course are not eligible to participate in the program. The course will be held on Wednesdays, 2:55-4:30pm, during the spring semester.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Who can I talk&nbsp;to&nbsp;about the India SVYM GSL Program?</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>ILR students contact Donna Ramil, Associate Director of International Programs and program coordinator for the India SVYM GSL Program, 117 Ives; email <a href=\"mailto:dmr47@cornell.edu%29\">dmr47@cornell.edu. </a><br>\r\n\t\t\tGMHs students contact <span>Jeanne Moseley, Program Coordinator, Global Health Program, HE Nutritional Sciences,&nbsp;Savage&nbsp;B15,&nbsp;email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jmm298@cornell.edu\">jmm298@cornell.edu</a>.</span></p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

ILR Exchange Programs provide a unique opportunity for ILR students to study abroad at a partner institution.&nbsp; Our partner institutions offer courses that are similar to ILR’s, which makes it possible for students to earn ILR elective credits while abroad.&nbsp; Exchange programs are reciprocal with ILR students going abroad and international exchange students coming to ILR, Cornell University. Currently the ILR School has student exchange programs in Australia, Italy, Spain,&nbsp;and the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Eligibility</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR faculty encourage students to take part in domestic and/or international, off-campus, credit-bearing programs during the academic year.&nbsp; These opportunities include the ILR Credit Internship Program, ILR Exchange, ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program, Cornell in Washington, and study abroad through the Office of Global Learning.&nbsp; Students may qualify to take part in these opportunities after completing their ILR-core requirements.&nbsp; Those who entered ILR as a freshman or as a sophomore transfer are permitted to take part in <strong>two</strong> off-campus semester programs, while junior transfers may do <strong>one </strong>off-campus semester&nbsp;program. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR juniors or seniors in good academic standing (see individual program pages for GPA requirements for each program) with all ILR core requirements completed are eligible to apply to participate in an ILR exchange program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students interested in the <a href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/special-study-options/international-experience/exchange-programs/universitat-rovira-i-virgili-spain\">URV (Spain) Exchange Program</a> must have basic Spanish language ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Courses and Credits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The course selections will be similar to ILR courses, so many of them can be applied towards ILR elective credits.&nbsp; This can be an important factor for transfer students.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"bulleted\">\r\n\t<li>Students can earn up to 15 ILR elective credits for a semester-long program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Courses have to be approved for ILR elective credit.</li>\r\n\t<li>Students will receive credit for academic coursework completed abroad that is equivalent to a Cornell grade of \"C.\"</li>\r\n\t<li>Students cannot take courses as Pass/Fail.</li>\r\n\t<li>All courses and grades will appear on the Cornell transcript in the same format as they are recorded on the original transcript generated by the host institution.</li>\r\n\t<li>Grades are not calculated in the overall GPA.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tuition and Costs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students on Exchange pay ILR tuition with NO additional fees (this can be a very good deal for in-state students).&nbsp; Room and board, books, airfare, in-country travel, visa fees, and all other personal expenses would be additional.&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial aid would apply.&nbsp; Students studying in Australia may apply for the Brooke and Glenn Grindlinger Australia Travel Award, a $2,500 award to cover travel costs.</p>\r\n",

International Experience</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Completion of one significant international experience is required. The following types of experiences are acceptable:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\">\r\n\t<li>Study abroad for a semester or a year</li>\r\n\t<li>International credit internship</li>\r\n\t<li>Participation in a service learning program abroad</li>\r\n\t<li>Conducting honors thesis research abroad (not part of a study abroad experience)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>The experience must be completed in a country other than the United States, different from your country of origin, and different from the country in which you did much of your schooling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experience must constitute significant engagement for a substantial period (at least longer than one month). The experience must be anchored around courses, research, or service learning projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Foreign Language Study</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twelve language credits must be completed (three consecutive courses in a single foreign language). Languages taken elsewhere (e.g. while studying abroad) will count towards the 12 credits;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One course must successfully be completed at the 2000 level;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A student may take a CASE (Cornell Advance Standing Exam) in a language in which he/she is proficient. A passing score will fulfill the ILR Global Scholars language requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. GPA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A minimum GPA of 3.6 is required for acceptance into the program, and students must maintain at least a 3.5 gpa at graduation to receive the Global Scholars Program designation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. International/Comparative Courses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha;\">\r\n\t<li>The IC distribution requirement of ONE course must be met.</li>\r\n\t<li>An additional FOUR international/comparative courses must be taken. These courses may be taken from the list approved for the IC distribution requirement or may be taken from anywhere else in the university if approved by the student’s advisor (TWO 7 week 2 credit courses can be combined to count as a course)</li>\r\n\t<li>THREE of the five courses must be taken inside ILR</li>\r\n\t<li>THREE of the five courses may focus on a particular region of the world but the remaining two courses must focus on other regions. For example, three courses can be taken on East Asia or China but the other two must deal with other regions, such as Latin America, Europe, Africa, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>ALL courses must be taken for a letter grade.</li>\r\n\t<li>A maximum of ONE course taken while studying abroad will count towards the course requirements. However, language courses will qualify for the language requirement.</li>\r\n\t<li>Independent studies or honors theses (on international topics) will count as ONE course towards the GSP.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Reflective Paper</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reflective paper (of approximately ten pages) that is based on the sum of the student’s international experiences, coursework, and language learning, is to be submitted to the student’s GSP advisor. The paper must be submitted no later than the end of the student’s graduating term (the end of the student’s graduating term is defined as the last day of exams in the semester). This paper will be graded by the advisor on a pass/fail basis.</p>\r\n",

From that point on, you will be expected to manage your time and your schedule to complete the requirement without reminder.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Swim Test</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornell students are also required to complete a swim test before they can graduate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Requirement Waivers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Those requirements can be waived only by action of a University Committee. Contact the staff in the <a href=\"http://www.pe.cornell.edu/physed/\">Physical Education Department</a> (607) 255-4286 to arrange for registration, postponements and waiver petitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transfer Students</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Transfer students who have completed at least two semesters in another University are considered to have completed the physical education and swimming requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Failure to Complete Requirement</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not register for or complete Physical Education courses, you do not lose your academic standing (i.e. you are not on Warning or \"probation\"), but you could be prevented from graduating if you have not completed the requirement.</p>\r\n",

Forms may be submitted in person or via email at <a href=\"mailto:ilr_oss@cornell.edu\">ilr_oss@cornell.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<p>[[{\"fid\":\"37751\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":\"Propose a Study\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"file media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who will review my proposal?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Committee reviews your academic record, which should give reason for confidence that you can complete a self-initiated and self-determined study, and the scope of the topic (to be sure that you have identified a manageable amount of material).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When do I begin my independent study or directed study?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most 4990's are proposed at the end of a term (for the next semester) or at the very beginning of a term (within the first week).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How many credits will I receive?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the amount of work involved, and in agreement with the faculty member, you may request one, two or three credit hours for the study, and it may be ILR elective or general elective credit. If you and the faculty supervisor believe that you will be doing more work than one might expect for a three credit course, then you may request four credits and the faculty member will be asked to justify that fourth hour in a memo to the Academic Standards Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How will I be graded?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An ILR 4990 is graded as you and the supervisor have agreed. In most cases, students meet on a regular basis with the supervising faculty member, discuss the reading or research completed, determine the next steps and consult on the \"product\" (customarily, but not necessarily, a paper). At the end of the semester, the instructor submits a letter grade for the 4990.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Out-of-College supervision for independent and directed study</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may request that a non-ILR professor supervise an independent study. The proposal must include</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>description of the topic</li>\r\n\t<li>the methodology and resources to be used</li>\r\n\t<li>the amount of academic credit to be awarded upon successful completion of the project</li>\r\n\t<li>the division of work among the students (in the case of a directed study)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Forms need to be filed with the faculty member's College Registrar; for example, if you are doing an independent study in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, you need to submit their independent study form and file a copy with the ILR Registrar in 101 Ives Hall. (ALS forms are available in 140 Roberts Hall; Arts and Science forms are available in 61 Goldwin Smith Hall.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also need to print out and submit an&nbsp;[[{\"fid\":\"57426\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":\"ILR Out-of-College Independent Study form\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"file media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]] to the Office of Student Services.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>Undergraduate students completing their Junior year with a 3.7 cumulative gpa at the end of the spring term are eligible to request candidacy for Graduation with Honors and to propose Honors Thesis Research.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proposals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Honors Thesis proposal should be a full statement of the topic, the scope of the study, the methodology, and the materials to be used in the research. Proposals should be approximately five pages long, including the reading list. The proposal is a demonstration of a commitment to an extensive study, so it should be developed in close consultation with the faculty supervisor. An initial proposal should be prepared at the end of the spring term, and refined in reading and research in the summer months. The Academic Standards Committee now expects that proposals will be submitted for review at the end of the spring term prior to the fall registration for Honors Research or, at least prior to the first week of fall semester classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Schedules and Expectations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While the proposal is being developed, the faculty supervisor and the candidate should agree upon a schedule of meetings, target dates for the submission of interim reports or preparatory papers or chapters of the study, and the expected date of submission of the near-final copy of the thesis to be defended. This continues the progress of the study and prevents misunderstandings about the scope and direction of the study. Revisions may be completed well before the thesis defense if a near-final copy is available to the supervisor and the Second Reader in March. The student must defend before the last day of classes in the spring term.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Criteria</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Academic Standards Committee recommends that the faculty supervisor inform the candidate of the criteria to be used in evaluating interim papers or chapters and the completed thesis. In general, the Committee believes that an Honors Thesis should demonstrate the student's capacity for quality research and should give evidence of mastery of the material. More important than any general standard is the mutually accepted understanding of the criteria to be used by the faculty supervisor in evaluating all of the work of the candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Second Reader and the Thesis Defense</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The thesis should be examined and defended before the Faculty Supervisor and the Second Reader before the end of scheduled classes in the spring term. The Committee recommends that the Second Reader be involved early in the study, preferably early enough to be named as a reader when the proposal is submitted for review and surely no later than the March submission of the near-final draft. The faculty supervisor and the candidate should discuss the defense in advance, particularly clarifying the role of the supervisor as advocate or as critic of the paper, the role of the Second Reader, and expectations of the scope of the defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Grades and Honors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates for Honors should be aware that the Faculty Supervisor must make two judgments about the completed thesis research: what grade is appropriate, and does it merit Graduation with Honors? While those evaluations tend to be symmetrical, it is possible that thesis research earning a superior grade does not, in the assessment of the faculty supervisor, warrant Graduation with Honors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Expenses and Funds</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A small fund of money is available to assist with some of the costs of research, including travel and duplicating costs. The Academic Standards Committee reviews requests for these funds and decides upon equitable allocations based on estimates before the expenses are incurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Signatures and Approvals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Honors Thesis Research proposal submitted to the Academic Standards and Scholarships Committee should be accompanied by the [[{\"fid\":\"7701\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":\"Honors_Thesis_Signature_Form.doc\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"file media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]] which has the signatures of the applicant, the supervising faculty member, and the Chairperson of the faculty member's department. Those signatures attest to the signatories' common understanding of the scope of the study, the commitments of time necessary to complete and to supervise the research, and the faculty member's judgment that the applicant has the ability to complete the proposed study in a satisfactory manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Grades and Eligibility</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Candidates for Graduation with Honors are required to maintain a minimum gpa of 3.7 during both of the semesters in which they are conducting research and writing the thesis. If a candidate drops below 3.7, eligibility for Graduation with Honors ends. The supervising Faculty member must then determine if the research done to that point is sufficient to qualify for four credits per semester of Independent Study (ILR 4990).</p>\r\n",

The University has a <a href=\"http://www.cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html\">Code of Academic Integrity</a>, as does each school and college at Cornell, including ILR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In principle, academic integrity requires that you submit only your own work for evaluation; that you acknowledge the work, words and conclusions of others to be the borrowed product of their effort; and that you do nothing to advantage yourself unfairly over others in your academic efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>In practice, academic integrity requires:</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>that you bring no unauthorized materials into exams and test rooms, and neither give nor use assistance or information not expressly approved by the course instructor;</li>\r\n\t<li>that you research, write and submit your own essays, research papers and term projects;</li>\r\n\t<li>that you collaborate with others to prepare for exams and to complete group projects up to the limits set by the instructor in your courses and no further;</li>\r\n\t<li>and that you follow copyright restrictions on computer software, use computer hardware fairly and appropriately, and submit only your own computer-assisted work, according to the limits set by instructors in your courses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>If you are believed to have violated the code</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If an instructor has reason to believe that you have violated the ILR Code of Academic Integrity, he or she will schedule a Primary Hearing, usually with the Director of the Office of Student Services as a witness, to present the evidence for the allegation and to enable you to respond to or refute the allegation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Penalties, suspension, or expulsion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The instructor decides, then, if the allegation stands and what penalty should be applied. Instructors can apply penalties such as a lowered grade or a failing grade on the assignment or for the course. If an instructor thinks your infraction requires suspension or expulsion, he or she must ask for a hearing by a Faculty-Student Academic Integrity Hearing Board, which reviews the entire case and arrives at an independent decision. They may support or deny the penalty desired by the instructor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Filing an appeal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you believe that a finding or penalty imposed by an instructor is unjustified, you may appeal to a Faculty-Student Hearing Board, which may confirm or modify the penalty (eliminating, reducing or increasing it) depending on the decision of the full Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Code of Academic Integrity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A copy of the complete Code of Academic Integrity is available on this web page. The Code should be consulted so you may know the procedures and the rights to counsel that you have in both Primary Hearings and Board Hearings.</p>\r\n",

Some reasons to take a leave may include: time needed for a special project, the need to re-kindle motivation and enthusiasm in academic study, financial difficulties, time needed to renew self-confidence and health, or career experience in an internship or job. A Leave of Absence is requested if/when you must leave the University and plan to return at a later time. A leave is granted upon request for up to two years. A request for extension of the leave past two years must be requested in writing prior to the end of the last semester on leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves of absence typically last for at least six months and are not generally granted for more than two years. A leave of absence granted during the semester goes into effect&nbsp;based on the day the student submits the University Withdrawl Form to the ILR Registrar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Leave of Absence requested before the final drop deadline of the semester carries two implications:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>that the student on Leave may request return in the next semester</li>\r\n\t<li>that there will be no record of classes and grades for the semester</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After the final drop deadline, the notation \"W\" will be entered for the courses in which a student is registered, and the student may not expect to return to classes until an entire semester has elapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Types of Leaves</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Personal (Voluntary) Leave</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>May be taken for an up-coming semester or prior to the drop deadline of the current semester without grade penalty. Personal (Voluntary) leave should be requested in writing submitting the University Withdrawl Form.&nbsp;Individual circumstances will determine what kind of leave a student may take (personal or Health related). Students will receive written confirmation of their leave from the ILR Registrar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students may return from a personal leave whenever they wish (typically within two years). Exceptions may be granted given individual circumstances.

(See Academic Standing).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Required leave may be issued by the University Judicial Administrator for violation of codes of conduct, laws, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Health Leave</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>May be taken if a student consults with University Health Services (Cornell Health) about this option; the ILR School will grant and readmit a student from a medical leave only upon the recommendation of Cornell Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a student is taking a leave for emotional or psychological reasons, it will usually be for at least six months. Cornell Heath Counseling and Psychological Services will devise a plan with the student to be undertaken while on health leave. Therapy, work, and academic endeavors may be part of the plan. The ILR School will determine what academic endeavors a student may be required to meet while on health leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a student taking a health leave is on Academic Warning, the ILR School may stipulate additional conditions for the leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Withdrawal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If, in mid-semester, a student decides to withdraw from Cornell University, with no intention of returning, they must submit the University Withdrawl Form and submit it to the ILR Registrar.&nbsp; The student’s withdrawl from the university will be effective the date the student submits the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a student requests a Leave of Absence or withdraws, it is their responsibility to contact the following offices prior to leaving to find out about possible implications of doing so:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul type=\"disc\">\r\n\t<li>Office of Student Services, 101 Ives Hall</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://health.cornell.edu/services/health-leave-absence\">Cornell Health </a>(if the leave is health related)<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-5155</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.bursar.cornell.edu/\">Bursar's Office</a>, 260 Day Hall<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-6413</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://finaid.cornell.edu/\">Financial Aid Office</a>, 203 Day Hall<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-5145</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://campuslife.cornell.edu/dining/dining.asp?catID=162\">Cornell Dining</a>, 206 Robert Purcell (if you have a dining plan)<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-8582</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://housing.cornell.edu/\">Residence Life</a>, 119 Robert Purcell (if you live in University housing)<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-5511</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Where to Find Support and Additional Resources</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage students to make OSS, 101 Ives, their first stop when questions or problems arise.

ILR hopes to help students avoid such situations in the following ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First-Year Student Advising</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR First-Year students meet with their colloquium professor during orientation and then regularly throughout the first month of the fall semester. That professor is also the student's faculty advisor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Requesting a Faculty Advisor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the spring term of your Freshman, Sophomore and Junior years, you will be asked if you wish to be advised by a member of a particular ILR department. If you do, the department will assign a faculty member to be your advisor and will notify you of your advisor's name. If you do not wish to have an advisor, one will not be assigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Faculty Advisors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR Faculty Advisors can be helpful for information about courses of study in their departments, about course combinations that build competence in the field as you raise questions about graduate study in their disciplines, and about career possibilities which utilize your ILR degree.</p>\r\n",

Committed to the principle of need-blind admission, Cornell University and the ILR School seek and welcome students, staff and faculty who are culturally, ethnically, racially and in other ways diverse. We endeavor to appreciate and respect the various narratives that every group brings to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A critical part of your educational experience will involve interactions with fellow students of diverse backgrounds and experiences. Our belief in the value of academic freedom leads us to favor classes, forums, and other campus activities where ideas are freely and openly exchanged. I encourage you to join with other students and the faculty and staff to celebrate and benefit from the demographic and intellectual diversity that is a hallmark of this extraordinary university.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h3>What is EOP?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Educational Opportunities Program (EOP) is a state supported program intended for New York State students who meet economic and academic criteria set forth by the College, State Programs Office, and New York State Board of Regents. For more information contact the <a href=\"http://www.omea.cornell.edu/heop/About-HEOP.cfm\">State Programs office</a>, or contact <a href=\"mailto:jm2664@cornell.edu\">Jessie Mancilla</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the Pre-freshmen Summer Program?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pre-freshmen Summer Program is a rigorous six-week summer program designed to help students prepare for the challenges of their first year at Cornell. ILR students take courses that are counted towards their ILR core requirements for graduation.&nbsp; Students must be invited to participate. Those admitted through special programs such as EOP (Educational Opportunity Program) or HEOP (Higher Education Opportunity Program) are required to attend.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is the LSC (Learning Strategies Center) and what services do they offer?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://lsc.cornell.edu/\">The Learning Strategies Center</a> is the central academic support unit at Cornell University that provides undergraduate students with tutoring and supplemental courses in Biology, Chemistry, Economics, Mathematics and Physics. Assistance in improving general study skills is available through semester long courses, workshops, individual consultations, and web site resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What diveristy and inclusion programs exist in the ILR School?</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We have several yearly programs geared towards preparing students to lead and collaborate in a diverse world. The Social Justice Education Program is the umbrella program that houses the following intiatives:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diversity Zone</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 90-minute training that discusses the historical and current implications of race and class in the United States. Participants will engage in various activities that will help them self-reflect on their own intersecting identities and cross-cultural conversations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Ally Days</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A two day educational celebration to engage the ILR community in conversation about what it means to be an ally to various marginalized groups. During this two-day event, the community will be able to stop by various tables, gather materials, pick up swag, enjoy a snack, and take photos at the live photo booth. This program is sure to resonate with people from all walks of life and present the concept of allyship in a fun way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Making It In Series</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Making It In Series is a new diversity and inclusion program in collaboration with Alumni Affairs and Development, ILR Office of Career Services, and the Office of Student Services. The goal is to connect students with underrepresented identities (people of color, queer folks, people with a disability, women, etc.) with alumni who share in those identities. Each session focuses on a different industry that ILR students are interested in and provides an opportunity for students to gain advice on navigating spaces as the “only one”, as well as career advice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>An Executive Outlook on Diversity and Inclusion</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This programs brings together top executive from various ILR fields to discuss the very important work of diversity and inclusion and how it impacts the companies they work for. In the past, we have had executives from Major League Baseball, National Football League, <span>Deutsche Bank Wealth Management, BET, and Extended Stay America. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Lunch &amp; Learn Discussion Series for Faculty and Staff</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This series provides an opportunity for faculty and staff to engage in conversation about the social issues that impact our society and the workplace. Past sessions have included the popular documentary, <em>Race: The Power of An Illusion</em>.</p>\r\n",

Course work that develops critical thinking, analytical skills, writing and quantitative abilities all serve as strong preparation for the study of law.<br>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Activities and work experience are important although not key factors in law school admissions. Decisions on most graduate school applications are more heavily based on an applicant's GPA and LSAT score. Faculty recommendations, typically two or three, are also important in the process, particularly when a student is being considered for law school scholarships.<br>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>An increasing number of ILR graduates decide to work for 1-3 years before applying to law school, a pattern reflected campus-wide as well as nationally. Over the past two years (2012 and 2013), ILR's Career Services Post-Graduate Report reflects this trend, showing only 12 percent of ILR graduates going directly to law school.<br>\r\n\t\t&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Application materials should be submitted to law schools through LSAC in the fall semester, usually between Thanksgiving and the published deadlines, with Early Decision/Early Action deadlines being sooner. Keep in mind that law school decisions may be made on a rolling basis, which means that early submission of applications is preferable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>With the ILR International Travel Grant, I traveled to Santiago in the Dominican Republic. The purpose of my trip was to learn more about labor rights in the Dominican Republic and if these rights have developed since the passage of the Dominican Republic Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). This topic is the concentration of my honors thesis. In 10 days, I learned about the Dominican Labor Court system and the procedures that workers and employers must undergo when they have conflicts that they want to resolve. I also visited two apparel factories in one of the largest Santiago export processing zones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the connections that Professor Compa has established with the Escuela Nacional de La Judicatura, I interviewed three prominent labor courts judges. First, I interviewed Aida Nunez, President of the Labor Court of First Instance of Santiago, accompanied by Carlos Martinez, President of the Second Hall of the Labor Court of First Instance of Santiago. The judges emphasized that there are two sides to the Dominican labor system: administrative and judicial. The administrative component consists of the Ministry of Labor and the judicial component consists of the Labor Courts of First Instance, the Labor Court, and the Supreme Court. A noteworthy point the judges made is that every district in the Dominican Republic does not have the resources to establish this intricate court structure, and some districts, such as La Vega, only have one judge who presides over all civil and criminal matters, including labor issues. When I asked the judges about the main obstacles they encountered when trying to do their work in an effective manner, they identified three main issues including: the number of judges versus the number of cases, the formality of the judicial process, and external issues such as the lack of energy resources (when the generator shuts down). Considering that the labor court system in Santiago is one of the most advanced in the Dominican Republic, there are clearly many improvements that should be made to ensure that worker's rights are protected by the courts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second interview was with Nancy Salcedo, President of the Labor Court of Santiago. This court is the appellate court that considers appeals from the Labor Court of First Instance. In addition, when employers want to discharge a union employee, the court determines whether the discharge is justified. Either the employer or the union employee can appeal the court's decision to the Supreme Court but employers must receive authorization from the court before discharging the employee. While this, and other institutional structures evolving out of the provisions of the Dominican Labor Code seem very progressive, there are many districts that do not have this type of system in place yet. When I asked Judge Salcedo about labor rights in the Dominican Republic, she argued that they have virtually remained the same. She stated that cases involving export processing zones have declined due to plant closings and the increase in informal labor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After meeting the judges and gaining more information about the labor court system, I visited two factories in the Santiago export processing zone. While I was not able to speak with the workers in either factory, I had the opportunity to walk around the factory (accompanied by management) and analyzed the differences between the larger factory that had 5 unions and a collective bargaining agreement and the smaller factory with no union. I gained a lot of information through my visits and will be sharing my findings in my honors thesis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I am grateful to have had the opportunity to substantiate my honors thesis with the information I gained through direct observation and field research that would not have been possible without the ILR International Travel Grant.</p>\r\n",

Introduction</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This edition of the Handbook contains all the policies and practices currently authorized by the ILR Faculty for the conduct of graduate study. The contents should be viewed as a supplement to the Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty of Cornell University and to ILR Faculty Legislation. The Graduate School Code as interpreted by the Dean of the Graduate School and/or its General Committee governs all graduate study at Cornell. Exceptions to policies prescribed by the Graduate School Code with respect to candidates for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are made by petition to the Dean of the Graduate School, though usually with endorsement of the field of study. Other policy matters involving the ILR M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, and policies governing the ILR professional degrees are set forth in this handbook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students may petition the ILR Graduate Committee for a waiver or substitution of certain requirements. The student must have a compelling reason for deviation, demonstrate acceptable alternative for competence and have written approval of his or her advisor or Chairperson. Final decision is the prerogative of the ILR Graduate Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The policies in this handbook are subject to change by action of the Faculty, at which point this document will be revised.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>B. Organization of Graduate Programs in the ILR School</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Four graduate degree programs are offered in the Field of Industrial and Labor Relations:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The M.S. and Ph.D. which are primarily academic and research oriented;</li>\r\n\t<li>The M.P.S. (Master of Professional Studies),</li>\r\n\t<li>The M.I.L.R. (Master of Industrial and Labor Relations) which are considered professional degrees.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The requirements, standards and recommendations for the M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs are established by the Graduate Faculty of the University. The establishment and maintenance of the requirements for admission, the standards of instruction, and requirements for degree completion for the M.I.L.R. and M.P.S. degree programs is the responsibility of the ILR Graduate Faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"/node/17646\">ILR Graduate Field Faculty</a> is comprised of members of the university faculty, generally with primary faculty appointments in ILR. Faculty members are nominated for membership in the ILR Graduate Field by current members of the Field. The nomination and supporting documents are reviewed by the ILR Graduate Committee who forward their recommendation to the General Committee of the Graduate School to finalize. The Dean of the Graduate School makes the final approval and notifies the Field and the faculty member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Director of Graduate Studies (D.G.S.), a member of the ILR field faculty, is responsible for carrying out the mandates of the University Graduate Committee and the ILR Graduate Committee. The D.G.S. is also responsible for communicating policies, procedures, and other graduate business to the members of the Graduate Field Faculty, students and staff. The D.G.S. convenes and presides over admissions committee meetings and other graduate field meetings. The Director of Graduate Studies is elected by the ILR Field Faculty.</p>\r\n",

The M.S. and Ph.D. degree are appropriate for students considering an academic or research career in human resources or labor relations. most applicants apply for both the M.S. and Ph.D. program planning to complete both degrees in ILR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"administration\" name=\"administration\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Administration of the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ph.D. study at Cornell University is regulated by the General Committee of the Graduate School and the policies set forth in the <a href=\"https://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/sites/gradschool.cornell.edu/files/field_file/Code%20FINAL%20Version_CODE_Oct%202014%20BAK%20%282%29.pdf\" style=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty</a>. This Code of Legislation sets forth the rules governing graduate education as established by the graduate faculty of Cornell University. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the various regulations that apply to their programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"admissions\" name=\"admissions\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Admissions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants may apply to the M.S./Ph.D. or Ph.D. program. Most applicants to the M.S./Ph.D. program have a background in the social sciences. Ph.D. applicants typically have advanced academic training in the social sciences, generally in one or more of the following fields: anthropology, economics, government, history, psychology, sociology, or statistics. Ph.D. applicants also typically have a master's degree in a subject related to their intended program and must submit their research based thesis with their application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M.S. degree candidates in the Field of Industrial and Labor Relations who wish to be considered for admission to the Ph.D. program upon completion of the M.S. degree should inform the chair of their Special Committee well in advance of the final examination for the M.S. degree. If the Special Committee wishes to use the M.S. final examination to determine the suitability of a graduate student for the Ph.D. program, the oral examination must be conducted with an additional member of the Graduate Field Faculty, appointed by the ILR Graduate Committee, present. The additional member shall not have a vote on awarding the M.S. degree, although his opinion may be registered. He shall have a vote in recommending admission to the Ph.D. program, to the ILR Graduate Committee. Decision on admission to the Ph.D. program remains with the ILR Graduate Committee (as representative of the entire field).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants are required to submit a completed Cornell Graduate Application (and application fee); statement of purpose; complete transcripts from all institutions attended; GRE or GMAT Test scores; TOEFL scores from international applicants*; a resume or CV, and 2 letters of recommendation from a college or university faculty member acquainted with applicant's academic work. A writing sample is strongly encouraged. Ph.D. only applicants must submit a copy of their research based master's thesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*International graduate students are admitted with the same criteria as US citizens, including the results of the aptitude tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). All international applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English language by submitting official test scores from a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) exam that meet Cornell's minimum sub-scores on each element of the TOEFL.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"committee\" name=\"committee\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Special Graduate Committee</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A student selects the members of the special committee, with their consent, from the current graduate faculty. Master's students must have at least two members of the graduate faculty on the special committee - one in the major subject (the chair) and one int he minor subject. When M.S./Ph.D. students complete the master's portion of their programs, the student is responsible for constituting a valid full Ph.D. committee by the deadlines established in the Code of Legislation and must file the online special committee change form. A doctoral student must have at least three members of the graduate faculty on the special committee - one in the major subject (chair) and two in the minor subjects. One of these minor members is required to represent a Graduate Field outside of Industrial and Labor Relations. At least two members of the committee must be general members of the graduate faculty. Students who are unable to constitute a committee with the required number of members cannot continue in the Graduate School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approved major and minor subjects for advanced study in Industrial and Labor Relations are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Human Resource Studies</li>\r\n\t<li>International and Comparative Labor</li>\r\n\t<li>Labor Relations, Law and History</li>\r\n\t<li>Organizational Behavior</li>\r\n\t<li>Labor Economics - Minor ONLY</li>\r\n\t<li>Social Statistics - Minor ONLY</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: Applicants who with to focus in statistics or economics should apply directly to the Graduate Fields of Statistics or Economics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The special committee, under the leadership of the committee chair, has primary responsibility for developing the student's independence and scholarship. Special committees and students are urged to meet at least twice a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"residency\" name=\"residency\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Residency Requirements: Registration Units</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A student's progress toward an advanced degree is determined not only by the quality of work completed (gauged through faculty evaluations and formal exams) but also by the length of time spent in pursuit of the degree. The Graduate School measures this progress in terms of registration units. Following each semester, the chair of the special committee attests the student's registration to the Graduate School. One registration unit corresponds to the satisfactory completion of one academic semester of full-time study and research. An individual is considered a full-time student if he or she is registered (including in absentia), enrolled in courses or engaged in thesis or dissertation work, and in conformity with limitations on assistantships, hourly student appointments, and/or outside employment specified in the Code of Legislation. The fraction of a registration unit granted for a semester of full-time study thus represents an evaluation of the student's academic progress by the special committee chair. Two registration units are the minimum requirement for an M.S. degree. Six registration units, two of them after the A Exam, are the minimum requirement for the Ph.D. degree. M.S./Ph.D. students matriculate first into the master's program and transition to the Ph.D. program when a master's degree is conferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Dean of the Graduate School and the special committee support the petition, a doctoral candidate (a student who has passed the A Exam) can be awarded up to four registration units for work done at another university after having registered at Cornell. No more than three registration units earned in this way can be counted toward the minimum requirement. Master's degree students may not count study in other graduate schools toward the registration unit requirement. With the approval of the special committee, a provisional or non-degree student whose status changes to regular degree may transfer up to two registration units completed while in provisional or non-degree status. See the Code of Legislation for further regulations regarding registration units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"course\" name=\"course\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Course Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no regulations of the graduate faculty governing the number of courses, grades, or specific content of instruction to which special committees must subscribe. The student's special committee is the sole judge of whether the student can efficiently prepare to fulfill degree requirements through formal or informal participation in courses. In principle, graduate students may enroll for any course offered by Cornell University. Students not enrolling in specific courses must enroll for thesis or dissertation research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"grades\" name=\"grades\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Grades</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The student's Special Graduate Committee reviews his or her degree progress and determines if academic warning or action is needed. In general students at this level of study are expected to maintain no less than a B average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"language\" name=\"language\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Language Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>International applicants must submit official TOEFL test scores that meet Cornell's official minimum sub-scores for each element of the TOEFL to qualify for admission to the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"teaching\" name=\"teaching\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Teaching Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Teaching is a requirement for the Ph.D. degree in this Field. The specifics are determined by the candidate's Special Committee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"exams\" name=\"exams\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Examinations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Required Examinations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the M.S. degree with a thesis, the graduate faculty requires the <strong>Final Examination for the Master's Degree</strong>. The graduate faculty requires the <strong>Examination for Admission to Candidacy (the \"A Exam\")</strong> and the <strong>Final Examination for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree (the \"B Exam\")</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n\t<dt><strong>Final Examination for the Master's Degree with a Thesis</strong></dt>\r\n\t<dd>A master’s student takes the final exam upon completion of all requirements for the degree but no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration unit requirement. This oral exam covers the topic of the master's thesis. If the M.S. degree is a prerequisite for the Ph.D. program, the Final Examination for the Master's Degree may be combined with the Examination for Admission to Candidacy, subject to special committee approval.</dd>\r\n\t<dt><strong>Examination for Admission to Candidacy</strong> <strong>(A Exam)</strong></dt>\r\n\t<dd>A student is admitted to doctoral candidacy after passing a comprehensive examination administered by his or her special committee. This exam is either oral or written and oral, as determined by the special committee. The passing of this examination certifies the student is eligible to present a dissertation to the graduate faculty.</dd>\r\n\t<dd>The A Exam may be taken after two registration units have been accumulated in a Ph.D. degree program or in a master's program leading to an M.S./Ph.D. degree in the same field. All doctoral candidates must attempt the Examination for Admission to Candidacy before beginning their seventh semester of registration in the Ph.D. program.</dd>\r\n\t<dt><strong>Final Examination for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree</strong> <strong>(B Exam)</strong></dt>\r\n\t<dd>A doctoral candidate takes the Final Examination upon completion of all requirements for the degree but no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration unit requirement. A minimum of two registration units must be earner between passing the A exam and scheduling the B exam. This oral exam covers the general subject of the dissertation.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Qualifying Exam</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the PH.D. examinations required by Graduate School legislation, the Field of Industrial and Labor Relations requires a qualifying examination for candidates for the Ph.D. degree. The qualifying examination should be administered as early in the period of residence as possible, preferably in the first semester after admission to the doctoral program. The examination serves to assist the Special Committee to determine the academic strengths and weaknesses of the candidate in his major and minor subjects and on the basis of its assessment to plan the content and sequence of the candidate's program of study.

Objectives of the M.S. Track for B.S. ILRs Degree Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Undergraduates in ILR may pursue a plan to earn the Bachelor of Science and the Master of Science degrees in ILR in five years if admitted to the M.S. program during the last year of the B.S. program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note</em>: Applicants to the B.S. ILR may not apply for the M.S. concurrently. The M.S. ILR is a separate degree program which requires a completed bachelors degree at the time of matriculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"administration\" name=\"administration\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Administration of the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The B.S. degree program is administered by the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, subject to Cornell University and New York State Department of Education regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M.S. study at Cornell University is regulated by the General Committee of the Graduate school and the policies set forth in the Code of Legislation of the Graduate Faculty. This Code of Legislation sets forth the rules governing graduate education as established by the graduate faculty of Cornell University. Faculty and staff in the graduate fields and the Graduate School are responsible for making these regulations available to students and prospective students. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the various regulations that apply to their programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"admissions\" name=\"admissions\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Admissions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students in the B.S. ILR program must apply for the one year M.S. ILR during their 4th year of undergraduate studies. If accepted, they work to complete the B.S. during the 4th year and in the 5th year the student enrolls as an M.S. student. Coursework taken in the senior year prepares students to do research and prepare the thesis in a 5<sup>th</sup> year of study, as an M.S. student. A GPA of 3.5, prior research experience with an ILR faculty member (e.g. senior honors thesis), and strong support of an ILR faculty member who agrees to act as the select committee chair and supervise the completion of the MS thesis is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE: The student is charged tuition at the undergraduate rate during the 4th year and at the graduate rate during the 5th year of study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants are required to submit a completed Cornell Graduate Application (and application fee); statement of purpose; complete transcripts from all institutions attended; GRE or GMAT Test scores; TOEFL Scores from international applicants*; a resume or CV, and 2 letters of recommendation from a college or university faculty member acquainted with applicant's academic work (academic references are preferred but professional references will be accepted).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*International graduate students are admitted with the same criteria as US citizens, including the results of the aptitude tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). All international applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English language by submitting official test scores from a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"committee\" name=\"committee\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Special Graduate Committee and Advisors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>B.S. students work with their select committee chairr to guide their degree program. The student also chooses a minor member for the committee, who will represent a minor concentration and cannot represent the same ILR department as your committee chair. M.S. students are required to have a full special committee established prior to the end of their second semester. We encourage you to put your special committee together as soon as possible as you are expected to write and defend your thesis in one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"residency\" name=\"residency\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Residency Requirements: Registration Units</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Graduate Faculty requires 2 registration units for the M.S. degree. Master's degree students may not count study in other graduate schools toward the registration unit requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"course\" name=\"course\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Course Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the senior year of the B.S. program students will enroll in courses which will prepare them to do thesis research. The fifth year features the M.S. thesis research, writing and defense. (In some cases the research takes more than one year to complete). There is no specific number of credit hours required for the M.S. degree but the Graduate School requires 2 registration units, which is 2 semesters of full-time, satisfactory graduate level work. A student's special committee is the sole judge of whether the student can efficiently prepare to fulfill degree requirements through formal or informal participation in courses. The graduate faculty does not differentiate between undergraduate and graduate courses, nor does it regulate the type or number of courses that a graduate student should take.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"grades\" name=\"grades\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Grades</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students are required to maintain a strong academic average (GPA 3.5), during their undergraduate program, as evidence of ability to work at the Master's level. Once in the M.S. program, the student's Special Graduate Committee reviews his/her degree progress and determines if warning or action is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"language\" name=\"language\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Language Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are no language requirements for M.S. degree candidates to graduate, however, international applicants must submit official TOEFL test scores to qualify for admission to the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"teaching\" name=\"teaching\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Teaching Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no teaching requirement for students in this degree program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"thesis\" name=\"thesis\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Thesis/Dissertation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The award of all research degrees is contingent upon the completion and submission of a bound thesis or dissertation constituting an original contribution to knowledge. As the M.S. is primarily a research oriented degree, student are required to submit a fully formed research thesis. As a means of improving thesis form and of assuring uniform thesis style, the Graduate School has regulations concerning the preparation of theses. After the degree is awarded, rights to publication of the thesis, dissertation, or related material belong to the author. The graduate is expected to acknowledge in the publication that the thesis or dissertation on which the publication was based was accepted by the graduate faculty in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree. One copy of the thesis becomes an official record of the University, held in the University Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"exams\" name=\"exams\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11. Examinations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cornell Graduate Faculty requires the Final Examination for the Master's Degree.A master’s student takes the final exam upon completion of all requirements for the degree but no earlier than one month before completion of the minimum registration unit requirement. This oral exam covers the topic of the master's thesis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A candidate for the M.S. must submit a complete draft of the thesis to all members of the special committee at least 6 weeks before the Final Examination, unless the special committee modifies this requirement. Students submit a complete readable copy of their thesis to the ILR Library 15 days prior to the final examination making it available for Faculty perusal. At least 5 business days before a Final Examination, a student must give each member of the special committee a final typed copy of the thesis or dissertation, complete in all respects and editorially acceptable for final approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The Final Examination may not be scheduled until the candidate has accumulated two units of registration.</li>\r\n\t<li>Announcement of the Final Examination is sent to the ILR Graduate Field Faculty.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Chairman of the Special Committee should make every effort to secure the presence of Graduate Faculty members who are not members of the candidate's Special Committee to be present at the examination.</li>\r\n\t<li>Determination of pass or fail rests exclusively with members of the Special Committee, but Graduate Faculty visitors who disagree with the Committee's conclusion may so inform the Dean of the Graduate School and request a review of the case in question.</li>\r\n\t<li>For a student to pass the examination, all members of the Committee must approve.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"recommendations\" name=\"recommendations\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>12. Recommendations for the Degree</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Submission of the final approved and bound thesis to the Graduate School signifies the student has satisfactorily completed the degree requirements.

Administration of the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Graduate Field of Industrial and Labor Relations administers the general requirements for the M.I.L.R. Degree through the ILR Graduate Committee. This Committee is composed of 6 elected faculty members, with the ILR Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the ILR Director of Graduate Studies as <em>ex-officio</em> members. This Committee reviews applications for admission, administers the program of study, and recommends the awarding of the degree for those who have satisfactorily met the requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"admissions\" name=\"admissions\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Admissions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Requirements for admission to the M.I.L.R. Degree Program include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Aptitude for graduate work as demonstrated by the GRE or GMAT examination and other appropriate criteria, including undergraduate (and previous graduate level) success and academic recommendations. NOTE: there is no specific minimum test score or GPA; applications are considered on all relative merits.</li>\r\n\t<li>A demonstrated desire and goals appropriate to this field of study, especially as expressed in the statement of purpose.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants are required to submit a completed Cornell Graduate Application (and application fee); statement of purpose; complete transcripts from all institutions attended; GRE or GMAT Test scores; TOEFL Scores from international applicants*; a resume or CV detailing applicant's work experience; 2 letters of recommendation from a college or university faculty member acquainted with applicant's academic work (academic references are preferred but professional references will be accepted), and a video interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*International graduate students are admitted with the same criteria as US citizens, including the results of the aptitude tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).

Faculty Mentors and Academic Advising</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon acceptance of our admission offer, each student will be assigned a faculty member representing the student’s selected concentration to serve as a mentor.&nbsp; The DGS and Director of Graduate Enrollment and Student Services will review assignments to ensure faculty availability and fit of student/faculty interests.&nbsp; The mentor role includes meeting with students as requested to discuss interests in the field, broader career directions, and assist with career clarification, to advise on opportunities to engage within and outside the ILR School, and to inform students of current areas of research (esp. for independent studies) and research opportunities in the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Verification of a student’s degree plan progress will be handled by the Graduate Office.&nbsp; The progress of students enrolled in the two-year program will be reviewed at the end of the first year, and again before the beginning of their last semester. Those enrolled in the one-year program will be reviewed at the end of their first semester.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A list of preapproved courses that satisfy each concentration will be used in reviewing student degree plans.&nbsp; Courses not on the list that students want to have approved will be reviewed by the Graduate Committee.&nbsp; The Graduate Committee may recommend courses to be added to or removed from the preapproved course list.&nbsp; Such recommendations should be based on consultation with faculty members representing the concentration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"residency\" name=\"residency\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Credit Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Satisfactory completion of forty-eight credit hours (at least sixteen courses) and minimum of 2 full-time semesters and a maximum of 4 full-time semesters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Registration beyond Degree Completion.</strong> The M.I.L.R. is a two-year program and students are expected to complete it within that time period. Students may complete the program in three semesters. Students who wish to continue in the M.I.L.R. beyond the completion of their degree must have a compelling academic reason, and must petition the DGS for approval to stay for an additional semester. Teaching and assistantships are limited, and M.I.L.R.'s who stay an additional semester typically will not be eligible to receive a teaching assistantship from the ILR School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Minimum and Maximum credit hours.</strong> All M.I.L.R. students must take at least twelve (12) credit hours and cannot take more than twenty (20) credit hours each semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"requirements\" name=\"requirements\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Course and Concentration Requirements</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All M.I.L.R. candidates must complete the following six core courses:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ILRLR 5000 Labor Relations</li>\r\n\t<li>ILRLR 5010 Labor and Employment Law</li>\r\n\t<li>ILRST 5110 Statistical Methods for the Social Sciences</li>\r\n\t<li>ILROB 5200 Organizational Behavior</li>\r\n\t<li>ILRLE 5400 Labor Economics</li>\r\n\t<li>ILRHR 5600 Human Resources Management</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Students who can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of a faculty representative of the appropriate subject area, that they have met the requirements for a required course in the M.I.L.R. program may petition for a waiver of the requirement. Petitions for waiver must be endorsed by the faculty member offering the course, and approved by the student’s advisor. Faculty members should endorse petitions for waiver only if they have determined, by examination or by other appropriate means, that the student’s grasp of the subject matter is equivalent to that which he would obtain in the M.I.L.R. required course. A waiver does not exempt M.I.L.R. students from completing the total number of credit hours or courses required for the degree, but may permit greater flexibility in the candidate's course selections to fill out the program credit requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M.I.L.R. students must declare a concentration no later than the end of the second semester of full time study. Students may change concentrations by notifying the ILR Graduate Committee (but must complete all requirements for the degree under the finally selected concentration). Students can choose to combine 2 concentrations but must have an advisor representing each concentration. The 5 M.I.L.R. concentrations are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Human Resources and Organizations</strong> - Students gain both a strategic overview of the HR function in an organization and a thorough understanding of the traditional activities of a human resource professional. This two-prong approach provides students with theoretical and practical applications. Faculty and students actively engage in discussion with senior corporate HR executives and gain hands on understanding of challenges and problem solving in organizations. In addition to 6 core M.I.L.R. courses, students can choose among courses in staffing, training and development, compensation, organizational behavior (micro and macro), comparative and international human resource management, computer application, human resource metrics, on-line research and reports, semester in manufacturing, human resource management for growing companies, and strategic human resource management.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Labor Market Policy</strong> - Seeks to prepare students for careers in public policy directed toward labor markets. These careers analyze, develop, and administer public policy, and will often bridge government, private firms, and non-profit organizations. The curriculum provides students with skills that will enable them to evaluate government policies, and with knowledge of public and private institutions that is fundamental to the operation of the labor market. Students take 6 M.I.L.R. core courses in addition to 6 courses that explicitly provide preparation for public policy oriented careers. These include two courses in the principles of policy evaluation, two courses in public policy directed toward labor markets, and 2 general policy courses that are selected by students subject to advisor approval.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Collective Representation</strong> - Designed to prepare M.I.L.R. students for careers in corporate industrial relations, trade unions, and governmental industrial relations roles. The curriculum can meet the needs of students who want to pursue a career in the United States or in an international setting. Recent graduates have taken positions as Director of Organizing for an industrial union, Labor Relations Specialist for the Federal Government, Corporate Director of Labor Relations, Field Examiner for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Labor Negotiator for a state Civil Service Association and Researcher for the International Labor Organization (ILO). Given the diversity in these career options, the concentration is quite flexible and is intended to meet student needs and interests. Like the other M.I.L.R. concentrations this concentration requires that students complete the 6 core M.I.L.R. courses and an additional 6 concentration courses. There are no set requirements regarding the nature of the elective courses. Rather, students should design a course of study that suits their needs with the advice and approval of their advisor.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong> - Designed to prepare M.I.L.R. students for careers as neutrals, advocates, or consultants in conflict resolution. The curriculum is designed for students who want to work in the United States for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) or the Department of Labor, in international agencies such as the International Labor Organization (ILO), or in other organizations dealing with conflict resolution. Given the diversity in these career options, the concentration is quite flexible and is intended to address student needs and interests.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>International and Comparative Labor</strong> - Seeks to provide M.I.L.R. students the opportunity to increase their understanding of international and comparative industrial relations, human resources and organizations, and labor markets. Particularly, it is expected that students will understand how different IR and HR policies and labor market institutions \"work\" in different national contexts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The concentrations are independent of the ILR Departments (Collective Bargaining, Labor Relations, Law, and History; Human Resource Studies; International and Comparative Labor; Economics; Organizational Behavior; and Social Statistics). Students who combine 2 concentrations must complete 6 courses in each concentration. A maximum of 3 courses which overlap both concentrations can be counted toward both areas with their advisor's approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional courses, seminars, or equivalent programs of study are chosen by the candidate, which added to the required courses must total forty-eight (48) credit hours and no fewer than sixteen (16) courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"courses\" name=\"courses\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Courses and Grades</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All courses taken toward fulfillment of the M.I.L.R. degree requirements must meet all of the following criteria:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The course number must be <strong>5000 level</strong> or above.</li>\r\n\t<li>The course must be taken for a <strong>letter grade</strong> - pass/fail or S/U grade option courses do not count toward M.I.L.R. degree requirements.</li>\r\n\t<li>The final course grade must be <strong>C or above</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li>All M.I.L.R.'s must maintain a grade point average of no less than <strong>B (3.0)</strong>.</li>\r\n\t<li>Courses that carry less than 3 credits will not count toward fulfillment of the M.I.L.R. degree requirements, unless combined with another less-than-3 credit class. Such instances will count as 1 course.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Independent Study Projects</strong> (ILR 7990) may be applied toward M.I.L.R. degree requirements if they contain substantial academic merit on subject material not covered in scheduled courses. A formal proposal must be submitted to the Graduate Committee for approval prior to undertaking the project. A maximum of 2 Independent Study Projects, and not more than 6 credit hours total, will be counted toward degree requirements.</li>\r\n\t<li>No course credit is allowed for internships and Independent Study Project credit will not be granted for internships.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Transfer credits are <strong>not</strong> accepted into the M.I.L.R. degree program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For any other exceptions or deviations from policy: <strong>The student must petition the Director of Graduate Studies and the Graduate Committee <em>prior</em> to taking the course in question.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A minimum grade of C is required for credit toward the degree, and students must maintain a grade average of not less than B. Failure to maintain these standards may be grounds for termination of assistantships or fellowships and/or dismissal from the program. At the end of each term, the ILR Graduate Committee or the Director of Graduate Studies will review the grade records and issue warning notices or recommendations for dismissal, as appropriate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courses withdrawn after the drop deadline will result in a \"W\" on a students transcript. The ILR Graduate Committee will not review petitions for exceptions to this policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"language\" name=\"language\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8.

Objectives of the Dual M.I.L.R./M.B.A. Degree Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dual M.I.L.R./M.B.A. Degree Program is designed to provide both a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) and a Master of Industrial and Labor Relations (M.I.L.R.) degree to students seeking comprehensive professional education in both fields. It allows students to complete academic requirements for both degrees while eliminating overlapping course work. In this five-semester program, students gain insight into the skills, capabilities, and best practices demanded in a workplace that requires intelligent, flexible and effective leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"admin\" name=\"admin\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Administration of the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a dual degree candidate begins taking courses at Cornell the student is considered a degree candidate in both the ILR School and Johnson regardless of the school in which the candidate is enrolled for a particular semester. The dual degree candidate may choose which semesters he/she will enroll in each college. Students must inform each college, where they plan to be enrolled prior to the start of each semester. Regardless of the college of enrollment, the dual degree candidate may take courses in either college during any of the five semesters. Students are governed by the policies of both colleges and subject to approval of their administrative entities; The ILR Graduate Committee in ILR and the corresponding entity in Johnson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"admission\" name=\"admission\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Admissions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants must apply and be admitted to both the M.B.A. program at Johnson and the M.I.L.R. program at the ILR School separately. Previous work experience is preferred, but is not required, for admission to ILR. Full-time work experience is not required by Johnson, but most of their students complete two to five years of full-time experience prior to enrolling. Johnson accepts a small number of outstanding applicants with less than one year of full-time experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requirements for admission to the M.I.L.R. Degree Program include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Aptitude for graduate work as demonstrated by the GRE or GMAT examination and other appropriate criteria, including undergraduate (and previous graduate level) success and academic recommendations. NOTE: there is no specific minimum test score or GPA; applications are considered on all relative merits.</li>\r\n\t<li>A demonstrated desire and goals appropriate to this field of study, especially as expressed in the statement of purpose.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Applicants are required to submit a completed Cornell Graduate Application (and application fee); statement of purpose; complete transcripts from all institutions attended; GRE or GMAT Test scores; TOEFL Scores from international applicants*; a resume or CV detailing applicant's work experience; 2 letters of recommendation from a college or university faculty member acquainted with applicant's academic work (academic references are preferred but professional references will be accepted); and a video interview.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>International graduate students are admitted with the same criteria as US citizens, including the results of the aptitude tests of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT). All international applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English language by submitting official test scores from a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Note: Students pay for two semesters at the ILR tuition rate and three semesters at Johnson rate.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"advisor\" name=\"advisor\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Advisors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students choose two advisors, one from each program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"residency\" name=\"residency\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>Cornell employees are welcome to apply to any ILR degree program for which they are qualified. Employee degree applicants must submit the same application materials and meet the same criteria as external applicants. Admission to ILR is competitive — about one-third of all applicants are accepted across all graduate degree programs — but please don't let that keep you from applying. Our selection committee will look at your application carefully to get a clear picture of your background, your interests, and your potential for succeeding at ILR. Similar to applying for a job, your application will be compared to those of others in the applicant pool, and the committee will make its selection on that basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Admissions Decision Factors</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Majors and Areas of Study</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Often entering students have an undergraduate major in the social sciences; the field of psychology is frequently well-represented in an M.I.L.R. class. However, it is not unusual to have fellow classmates who have been nurses, engineers or school teachers. All fields are considered in the admissions process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once admitted to the M.I.L.R. program you'll complete six required core courses and six courses from one of four concentrations: Human Resources and Organizations, Labor Market Policy, Collective Representation, and Dispute Resolution. Major and minor subject areas for the M.S. and Ph.D. are: Collective Bargaining, Labor Relations Law and Labor History; Human Resource Studies; International and Comparative Labor and Organizational Behavior. M.P.S. students will also choose their area of concentration from these areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Work experience</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We don't require it, but often nearly half of the incoming professional masters classes have spent a few years in the workplace, including the Cornell workplace. The mix of student experiences makes class discussion lively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Statement of Purpose</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement of purpose explains your reasons for undertaking graduate work and clarifies your academic interests. It is also an opportunity to tell the admissions committee anything about you as an applicant that is not already conveyed through your resume, transcripts, or test scores. You may also address any questions or discrepancies in your materials in your personal statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>GRE or GMAT</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll need to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) and have your scores forwarded to us. While it is important to do well on those tests, test scores are only one of many items considered in the admissions process, along with undergraduate coursework, recommendations, and the other materials contained in the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Transcripts</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We need transcripts from every college or university where you've ever taken courses. We don't compute grade point averages (GPAs) or use them as part of any formula. We prefer to look closely at the courses you've taken and the grades you've received.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Resume</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>All applicants are required to submit a resume with their application.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Letter of Recommendation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll need to arrange for two letters of recommendation from faculty members acquainted with your academic work. You may approach faculty members at Cornell, if you have taken courses extramurally, for your academic recommendations. You may also supplement the required two academic recommendations with one or two professional recommendations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Interviews</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We don't require an interview, although we're certainly happy to meet with you. Contact the ILR Graduate Programs Office at 255-1522.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Special Considerations for Employee Degree Applicants</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Admission to the ILR graduate degree programs is based on a competitive selection process, and is not automatic or guaranteed for Cornell University Employee Degree candidates. Therefore, for Cornell employees who are planning to apply to the M.I.L.R. and are taking ILR courses on an extramural basis for the purpose of applying those courses towards their degree, it is strongly recommended that applicants apply to the degree program prior to taking many relevant courses. <strong>The ILR Graduate Committee will only accept a total of 9 (nine) credits from Part-Time Study at Cornell (formerly Extramural Study) towards the M.I.L.R. degree program if admitted into the program as an Employee Degree. Completing all of the required coursework prior to admission to the program does not automatically grant the candidate admission nor the desired degree.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Employee Degree participants in the M.I.L.R. program are not required to spend any semesters as full-time students. Employee Degree participants in a Ph.D. program are required to complete a minimum of two semesters in full-time study. A doctoral student in the Employee Degree Program may petition to waive the requirement of full-time study if the special committee attests either that there is sufficient overlap between the student's employment and academic program or that the student is fully participating in the graduate program. Employee Degree candidates must follow all University and Graduate School policies regarding employment and study while in the employee degree program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike external candidates, <strong>Cornell employees who have successfully completed graduate level courses extramurally at Cornell prior to matriculating in the M.I.L.R. program</strong> <strong>may petition the ILR Graduate Committee to transfer up to 9 (nine) credits from their extramural studies toward their degree requirements.</strong> The courses must have been taken at the graduate level (5000) level or above, taken for a letter grade, and have a final grade of C or above. M.S./Ph.D. degree program candidates may petition the Special Committee to transfer up to two registration units from their extramural studies toward their degree requirements. The Committee has the option of accepting some of the course work, but may disallow some courses based on performance or academic relevance to the degree program. The Graduate School also has this option.</p>\r\n",

Degree is designed for individuals who are already practitioners, have a minimum of 8-10 years of work experience, and want to retool or redirect their efforts to a specific competency. It is appropriate for international students who wish to obtain training in the general area of industrial and labor relations and for domestic students who are employed in the human resources field and wish to upgrade their skills and understanding. This is an unstructured program, without specific prescribed courses, which requires a research project. The on-campus M.P.S. degree is a one-year, full-time residential program intended for mid-career professionals with extensive experience in the field. No financial aid is provided for the M.P.S. An employee degree candidate who is admitted to the M.P.S. program must meet these conditions; in particular the employer must pay standard M.P.S. tuition to the ILR School. A part-time ILR M.P.S. program is available in New York City (see our <a href=\"/node/4991\">Graduate Degree Programs</a> page for details).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"administration\" name=\"administration\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Administration of the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Graduate Field Faculty of Industrial and Labor Relations administers the general requirements for the M.P.S. degree through the ILR Graduate Committee. This Committee reviews applications, administers the program of study, and recommends the degree for those who satisfactorily meet the requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"admissions\" name=\"admissions\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.

All international applicants must demonstrate proficiency in the English language by submitting official test scores from a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) exam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a id=\"committee\" name=\"committee\"></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.

Rest assured contacts know you are seeking opportunities now or will be in the future, and many will offer to assist you. Focus on learning about the career field and gathering advice, develop additional contacts, and trust that you will naturally begin to hear about opportunities in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How do I Network?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The prospect of asking for help or information may make you feel uncomfortable. This <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/options/networking/index.cfm#CP_JUMP_4934\">guide</a> will help outline the \"How To's\" of networking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that we’ve convinced you of the value of networking, how do you find people with whom to network?

At the conclusion of the meeting, students who are interested in pursuing an internship for the next term are asked to schedule an appointment with the Managing Director to make a preliminary determination of eligibility and to discuss particular interests.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Seeking Advice</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>The decision to participate in the internship program may be a difficult one to make. Consideration should be given to your present academic and personal situation as well as to your future career and educational objectives. Seek advice from the many sources available to you - the staff of the Office of Student Services and the Office of Career Services, ILR and other faculty members, and students who have completed internship assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Application Submission</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Your completed application, which must be typed, should be submitted to the managing director in the internship office, 119 Ives Hall.&nbsp; Please email your completed CIP-2 form and resume to <a href=\"mailto:bk30@cornell.edu\">bk30@cornell.edu</a>.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h3>About the ILR School</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The School of Industrial and Labor Relations, on the Cornell University campus in Ithaca, New York, has long been recognized as a leader in its field. The first institution in the country to offer a comprehensive undergraduate program of professional training in industrial and labor relations, the ILR School remains the only college with a four-year program leading exclusively to the bachelor of science degree in the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Combining Theory &amp; Practice</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The founding faculty, recognizing the importance of combining theoretical and practical elements in the curriculum, instituted a requirement that all undergraduates work during all three summers between their college years in a labor union, a corporation, and a government agency. That requirement, although sound in principle, was dropped in the face of increasing student enrollment, higher expenses associated with college attendance, and a tightening job market. As a partial substitute, the faculty instituted a program to grant academic credit for internships undertaken during the academic year that provide students with opportunities to work at a professional level of responsibility in one of the careers encompassed by the field of industrial and labor relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Internships for Academic Credit</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Internships for academic credit are available to qualified ILR juniors and seniors. Students receive twelve credits for successfully completing the internship and a project or written report based on the experience. Eight of those twelve credits, reflecting the experience component, are graded as satisfactory or unsatisfactory; the other four are graded by the faculty supervisor on a scale of A to F.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"cs_control CS_Element_Textblock\" id=\"cs_control_520597\">\r\n\t<div class=\"CS_Textblock_Text\">\r\n\t\t<h2>How to Participate</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Organizations interested in having an intern from the ILR School should provide a description of the internship opportunity by completing the sponsor application form. Since the number of students receiving faculty approval for participation in the program is limited and every effort is made to match student interests with internship opportunities, the school cannot guarantee to fill all internships each semester. Organizations that provide the school with complete information early in the semester preceding that for which the internship is available are most likely to secure an intern. If possible, information about internship opportunities should be supplied by mid-October for spring semester internships and mid-March for fall semester placements.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h2>Optional Stipend</h2>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Since the purpose of the internship is to provide a working and learning experience for the student, and because academic credit is awarded for the experience, no compensation by the sponsoring organization is required. Many students, however, cannot afford to undertake an internship without some financial support. Most organizations offer a stipend directly to the intern to help cover the extra expenses associated with the internship.&nbsp; This stipend can take the form of a lump sum payment or a regular hourly wage.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

At their option, however, students may also live in off-campus housing arranged through UCD. The cost of on-campus housing is set annually by UCD. The semester cost of on-campus housing, which consists of a private room in a three or four person apartment with shared bathroom and kitchen facilities, is approximately $5,500 USD (depending on exchange rates) plus $750 USD refundable housing deposit (less any cleaning or damage charges if necessary). Final cost will be determined by the specific residence hall you select.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estimated cost of off-campus housing, which is available in privately-owned houses and apartments throughout the greater Dublin area, is approximately $6,000 USD&nbsp; including all utilities (depending on exchange rates) plus $750 USD refundable housing deposit (less any cleaning or damage charges if necessary).</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/node/18176\">Comprehensive Housing Information</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/residences/\">UCD On-Campus Residences</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>The ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program is unique in that credits awarded at UCD will be actual ILR credits, courses will have ILR numbers, and all grades at UCD will count toward&nbsp;the student's GPA.&nbsp; These will not be transfer credits as is typical of most study abroad programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because these credits will count toward your GPA, it is important that you seriously consider your&nbsp;preparedness and motivation before committing to the program.&nbsp; The focus of this study abroad program is, in fact, STUDY!&nbsp; Students should not view this as a vacation, a tour of Europe, or a great way to get away from Ithaca!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We expect students to attend class, meet all course requirements, take exams, and work hard!</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Curriculum</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to a course on Irish history and culture, which is designed to provide a frame of reference for understanding the modern and dynamic country that Ireland is today, students will take two courses especially developed by Quinn School faculty to help them understand those issues of work and workplace relations that the nations of the European Union are endeavoring to resolve in the cause of a more complete social, economic and political integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students will choose one other course from a list of elective courses addressing various aspects of human resource management and industrial and labor relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under special circumstances, ILR students may also be eligible to choose their elective course from the curriculum of the Smurfit School, the renowned graduate business school of University College Dublin and from departments outside of the Lochlann Quinn School of Business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students earn a minimum of 12 hours of ILR elective credit for their semester in Dublin. In most cases, the additional three credits earned for the course in Irish history and culture taken in Dublin may be counted in satisfaction of the ILR School’s Western Intellectual Tradition distribution requirement.&nbsp; Credits awarded for the course in Irish History will be considered transfer credit by the ILR School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All Quinn courses are taught with a series of formal lectures together with a strong emphasis on course work outside the classroom including project work, computer and library research, and class presentations.&nbsp; The Quinn School strongly emphasizes small classes with a cap of 50 students in upper-level classes.&nbsp; Each course meets for three hours with a three-hour formal examination at the end of the semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Required Courses</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Irish History &amp; Culture</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the course, themes such as Irish nationalism, identity and the use of history in the present will be explored.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several field trips are included&nbsp;in this course.&nbsp; Trips include outings to the Dáil and Kilmainham Gaol in Dublin and Stormont in Belfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>European Industrial Relations &amp; Human Resource Management</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The course has two main objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>to provide an understanding of industrial relations and human resource management (IR and HRM) practices in four Western European countries - Britain, Germany, Spain and Ireland. An introductory overview of IR and HRM practices in Eastern Europe is also provided.</li>\r\n\t<li>to develop a comparative analysis around a number of key issues: employers' organizations and the structure of collective bargaining; trade union growth, structure and policy; the role of the state; labour market regulation; European social policy; industrial relations regimes and regime competition; and finally, whether national systems of IR and HRM are converging or diverging.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Developments in the new accession states and in Eastern Europe more generally will also be examined, particularly where they are seen to have consequences for the shape of IR systems in Western Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Multinationals in the Global Economy (International HRM):&nbsp; Managing People</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The course on Multinationals has been designed specifically for our program and offers ILR students a unique experience by combining traditional classroom work with hands-on practical training with leading multinationals headquartered in Dublin.&nbsp;This course will be team taught and consist of a significant field work component.&nbsp; Topics to be discussed include:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Globalization, Multinationals and the Irish Economy</li>\r\n\t<li>Strategy, Structure and HRM in Multinationals</li>\r\n\t<li>Performance Management &amp; Pay</li>\r\n\t<li>Voice &amp; Work Organization</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Field work projects may include visits to the Irish Development Agency (IDA), the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), the Irish Business &amp; Employers Confederation, and the American Chamber of Commerce, and/or a variety of multi-national corporations operating in Ireland.</p>\r\n",

Founded in the mid-19th century and the alma mater of many of Ireland’s most important literary, cultural, commercial and political figures, UCD is now the country’s largest and most comprehensive university, annually enrolling more than 20,000 students in an impressive array of degree programs spanning several colleges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internationally accredited Quinn School of Business is the largest in Ireland and widely acclaimed both for the quality of its academic programs and the vitality of its campus life. Students enrolled in the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program not only enhance their understanding of the global field of industrial and labor relations, but are further enriched through their participation in a variety of engaging social and cultural activities designed by UCD staff to insure a study abroad experience that is personally, as well as academically, rewarding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please visit their website for more information on the <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/quinnschool/\">Quinn School of Business &amp; University College Dublin</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>UCD Contacts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your main contacts at UCD will be Ms. Madeline Molyneaux &amp; Dr. Roland Erne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Madeline Molyneaux</strong> is the Manager of the Study Abroad Programme at the Quinn School. Ms. Molyneaux will coordinate many of the programmatic details of your semester at UCD. You should not hesitate to contact her should you have any questions. She can be reached by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:roland.erne@ucd.ie\">madeline.molyneaux@ucd.ie</a> or by phone at 353-1-716-4710.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Roland Erne</strong> is the Dublin based Director of the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program and a professor in the IR/HR Group at the Quinn School of Business. Dr. Erne will be your main point of contact for any academic questions or concerns that may arise during your semester at UCD. Dr. Erne can be reached by e-mail at<a href=\"mailto:roland.erne@ucd.ie\">roland.erne@ucd.ie</a> or by phone at 353-1-716-4746.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Registration at UCD</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>UCD has a two step process to formally register as a student at UCD.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>At your mandatory orientation, UCD will provide you with detailed instructions on completing the on-line registration. This on-line registration is required just to validate your status as a student at UCD. You will be registered for courses automatically by the Quinn School. You must complete this on-line registration as soon as possible. You must have your student number and date of birth to register.</li>\r\n\t<li>The second step will be to collect your student ID card at the Student Centre, Astra Hall. This card will be available only after you have completed the on-line registration.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>You will not be permitted to register with the Irish Immigration Authorities until you have received your UCD student ID card.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Registering for Classes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program requires three of the four classes you will take during your semester, you will be pre-registered for these classes prior to your arrival at the Quinn School. Students are very likely to receive their first elective course selection as long as there are no scheduling conflicts. You will not be allowed to change elective classes once your selection has been submitted to UCD. Students will receive their actual course schedules during orientation at UCD. All course registration will be done automatically by the Quinn School.</p>",

Students will be asked to pay a deposit of $750 USD at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp; This deposit must be paid before your housing can be confirmed.&nbsp; You may use a credit card for this charge. This deposit is refundable at the end of the semester less the cost of any damage or cleaning charges.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tOnce housing has been selected, students can view their accommodation account online via UCD&rsquo;s SIS website.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accommodation menu is located in the information for students tap at the top of the page.&nbsp; To view your accommodation account and to make payments online please click on pay residential fees.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Moving In:</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tStudents are allowed to move into the residence halls on the Monday or Tuesday before classes start, usually the first week in September.&nbsp; The specific move-in date will be communicated to students early in the summer by University College Dublin and the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin office.&nbsp; Room keys will be available for pick-up at the reception desk of each residence hall until 10PM.&nbsp; Please contact the residence before you arrive to arrange for key collection, and if possible, try to arrive between 9:30AM and 5:00PM.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Furniture &amp; Furnishings:</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tEach bedroom contains a single bed and a duvet and pillow are provided.&nbsp; Students must buy or bring their own sheets and towels.&nbsp; Each bedroom also has a desk, chair, lamp and wardrobe/closet.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tKitchens are unfurnished and students must provide any specialty equipment such as woks, blenders, etc.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tTelevisions are not provided although you can rent one from a variety of shops in the city of Dublin.&nbsp; Students must pay a television license wish costs &euro;160 for the year.&nbsp; Licenses can be purchased at any post office.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tThere are no phones in the residence halls.&nbsp; Most students purchase their own cell phones.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Meal Plan:</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tAll on-campus residences, except for the Roebuck Castle, are self-catering and contain a small kitchenette. No meal plan is available in these residence halls, but UCD does offer a large student cafeteria and a convenience store is located on the ground floor of the Merville complex.&nbsp; Students are responsible for their own kitchen supplies and a basic set-up can be ordered through the Accommodations Office.&nbsp; You may also purchase kitchen items upon arrival in Dublin at one of the department stores in the city center.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Off-Campus Housing:</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tStudents have the option of choosing to live off-campus if they would like to live in the center of Dublin. Off-campus accommodations offer you the opportunity to live in the heart of a major international city within close proximity of restaurants, theatres, shopping, parks and a variety of other social and cultural attractions.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tAll off-campus accommodations are located near the Dublin city-center and are a short bus ride from UCD. Apartments are furnished, self-catering and students usually share a bedroom.&nbsp; Bedding and kitchen supplies are provided.&nbsp; Like on-campus housing, TVs and phones are not provided.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tOff-campus apartments are within walking distance of bus lines, and commuting time to UCD ranges from 20-30 minutes depending on traffic.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tThe off-campus accommodations are not owned by UCD but they have been vetted by UCD to assure that all flats are in convenient and safe neighborhoods.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tAll housing fees for off-campus housing are paid directly to the rental agents and not to UCD or Cornell.&nbsp; Payment is normally made by wire transfer.&nbsp; If you elect to live in off-campus housing, the rental agent will email you payment details.&nbsp; All fees must be paid on or before you take possession of your apartment.&nbsp; You will also be required to pay a one month deposit which will be refundable at the end of the semester, less any damage and cleaning fees.<br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t<strong>Electricity:</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\tIrish electrical current is 220 volts and their plugs are known as 3-pin flat.&nbsp; Irish voltage and plug style is different from the US and Canada so you will need to bring or buy a voltage convertor and plug adapter.&nbsp; Please note, plugs are different throughout Europe and you will thus need multiple adapters.&nbsp; Convertors and adapters are often sold as sets which include all the adapters you will need.&nbsp; They are available online and in stores that sell electronics.&nbsp; Many US electronics have dual voltage capacity (ie. laptops, cell phones, iPods, etc.), however many items such as flat irons, electric razors, etc. require a voltage convertor.&nbsp; Using these items without a convertor will likely destroy them!</div>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Housing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are going abroad in the spring semester, you may cancel your housing contract.&nbsp; To do so, you will need to submit your acceptance letter from the ILR/UCD Study Abroad Program to the Housing Office located in 206 Robert Purcell Community Center.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To contact the Housing Office, please e-mail <a href=\"mailto:housing@cornell.edu\">housing@cornell.edu</a> or call (607) 255-5368.&nbsp; You must also cancel your meal plan at the Cornell Dining Office.&nbsp; They can be contacted by e-mail at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:dining@cornell.edu\">dining@cornell.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The housing lottery for on-campus housing takes place during the early part of the Spring semester and can be done entirely on-line.&nbsp; You should visit the <a href=\"http://www.housing.cornell.edu\">Living @ Cornell website</a> at the end of January for complete information.</p>\r\n",

The numbers 3, 10, 11B, and the 17 all provide direct bus services to the Belfield campus; the number 3, 10 and 11B can be boarded at O&#39;Connell Street. The buses do stop running around 11:00pm, so always plan accordingly. The bus from the city center to UCD will take approximately 35-45 minutes depending on traffic. Please visit the <a href=\"http://www.dublinbus.ie/\">Dublin bus system website</a> for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aircoach.ie\">Aircoach</a> also operates a bus service to Leopardstown/Sandyford/Stillorgan which passes UCD to and from Dublin Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dublin&#39;s rail system or, <strong>DART</strong> (Dublin Area Rapid Transport), runs along the coast of Dublin. While there is no DART station near UCD, it is a great way to see the Irish coast. The DART runs from Malahide and Howth in the north to Greystones, County Wicklow in the South. You can connect to the regular train service for town north of Dublin as far as Belfast. DART services begin at 6:30am on weekdays and ends at 11:30pm. Please visit the <a href=\"http://www.dublin.ie/transport/dart.htm\">DART service website</a> for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transportation in Ireland &amp; Europe</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>UCD offers an on-campus student travel agency, USIT. USIT offers discount fares and travel planning among others services. You should also inquire about the travel save stamp which will make you eligible to transportation discounts. Holders of an International Student Identity Card travel at a 50% discount on trains throughout Ireland with a Travelsave Stamp, obtained from the USIT Office. The stamp also provides a 15% discount on bus fares outside Dublin, and substantially reduced weekly transit passes in Dublin.Visit the<a href=\"http://www.usit.ie/%20\">USIT website</a> to learn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travel within Ireland can be done by either train or bus relatively inexpensively.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.irishrail.ie\">Irish Rail</a></li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.buseireann.ie\">Bus Eireann</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Studying in Dublin puts students in the ideal position for European travel during their vacations and on weekends.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h4>Why should I choose the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin program is unique among study abroad programs.&nbsp; Unlike traditional study abroad, the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program allows approved ILR students to focus specifically on issues of work and workplace relations in the context of the European Union and the global economy.&nbsp; Students will earn ILR general elective credit, not transfer credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Who is eligible to participate in this program?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR juniors and seniors with GPAs of 3.0 or above are eligible to apply.&nbsp; Students must also be making normal progress toward graduation. Applicants are also required to provide a written statement of their educational and personal motivations for participation in the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program.&nbsp; All admissions decisions will be made by the Director &amp; Associate Director of Off-Campus Credit Programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What does it cost?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A sample budget is available under the <a href=\"/node/17991\">Cost, Billing &amp; Financial Aid</a> section.&nbsp; Tuition will be charged at the same rate (in-state or out-of state) as you are currently paying.&nbsp; Housing costs will vary depending on whether you choose to live on or off-campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Will I still be eligible for financial aid?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes!&nbsp; If you currently receive financial aid, you will continue to receive that financial aid while you are off campus.&nbsp; Financial aid may be adjusted up or down to reflect the comparative expense of studying in Dublin vs. Ithaca.&nbsp; For more information on financial aid, please see the <a href=\"/node/17991\">Cost, Billing &amp; Financial Aid</a> section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Can I work while I'm abroad?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No.&nbsp; You may not work while you are abroad whether you are currently receiving federal work study support or if you are just looking to make a little extra spending money.&nbsp; Students are not allowed under Irish immigration law to work in Ireland at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How many credits will I receive?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Students will receive 12 ILR general elective credits for their participation in this program.&nbsp; All students are also required to take a 3 credit class, Introduction to Irish History &amp; Culture.&nbsp; This class may count toward the ILR Western Intellectual Tradition requirement.&nbsp; If a student has already completed that requirement, the 3 credits will count as 3 transfer credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Will these courses count toward my ILR requirements?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, these courses will count toward your 40 ILR General Elective requirements.&nbsp; Moreover, all of these courses will be considered IC credit and will count toward your IC requirement.&nbsp; Finally, Irish History &amp; Culture may be counted as your Western Intellectual Tradition requirement if it has not already been fulfilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can I get a copies of syllabi to review?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes.&nbsp; Syllabi are available for approved UCD courses.&nbsp; However, these syllabi are not always the most up-to-date versions and should be used only as a guideline in your decision-making.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Is housing available?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the ILR School has guaranteed on-campus housing for all of our students.&nbsp; However, interested students are also eligible to live off-campus if they would like to.&nbsp; For more information on the different housing options, please visit the <a href=\"/node/18176\">housing section</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/campusdevelopment/developmentprojects/studentstafffacilities/\">UCD housing</a> website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you arrive prior to the program's start date or choose to remain abroad following the end of the semester, you are responsible for arranging and paying for accommodation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Once I'm abroad, how do I register for next semester's classes?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You will continue to receive regular email from the Office of Student Services, including notifications on pre-registration.&nbsp; For students who are abroad, you should pre-enroll just as you would if you were on-campus.&nbsp; Any questions on the process or on course selection should be directed to Jenn Weidner (<a href=\"mailto:jlw297@cornell.edu\">jlw297@cornell.edu</a>) in OSS <strong>BEFORE</strong> your scheduled pre-enrollment date.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Will I still be able to make use of the Office of Career Services?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes.&nbsp; We encourage you to make an appointment to speak with a Career Services counselor before you leave for your semester abroad.&nbsp; They will give you detailed information on the process for full-time and summer internship recruiting while you are in Dublin.&nbsp; The Career Services advisor for off-campus students is Marcia Harding.&nbsp; She can be reached by email at <a href=\"mailto:mlh15@cornell.edu\">mlh15@cornell.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How will study abroad affect my health insurance?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Every student who goes abroad through the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program must secure health insurance that gives them complete medical and accident insurance while abroad.&nbsp; This insurance can be obtained through the Cornell Student Health Insurance Program or through a private insurer.&nbsp; For more information, please see the <a href=\"/node/18186\">health insurance</a> section of this website under Safety, Security &amp; Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Can my health and safety be guaranteed if I study in Ireland?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No, no more than they can be guaranteed here on the Cornell campus in Ithaca.&nbsp; Ireland has a relatively low crime rate, and study there is unlikely to be any riskier than studying here on campus.&nbsp; In the end, your personal behavior and preparation will be the most valuable in maximizing your health and safety while you are abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students participating in this program are eligible for all the services available through UCD's Student Health Service.&nbsp; SHS provides on-campus medical, psychological, and psychiatric care to all registered students.&nbsp; The Student Health Service is located on the first floor of the Student Centre building, adjacent to the Sports Centre &amp; Science Buildings.&nbsp; For more information, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/stuhealth/\">SHS website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Do I need a visa?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>No, you do not need a visa to study in Ireland if you are a US citizen or a US permanent resident. You will, however, need a passport.&nbsp; Passport applications should be made at least 6 months in advance of the semester you intend to be abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport\">U.S. Passports and International Travel</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>International students may need visas, and should consult with the Office of Off-Campus Credit Programs and the Office of International Students &amp; Scholars for more information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Are international students eligible?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, international students are eligible. However, international students wishing to participate in this program should schedule an appointment to meet with ILR’s Office of Off-Campus Credit Programs and Cornell’s Office of International Students &amp; Scholars before committing themselves to the program. Time spent overseas could affect your immigration status. You may also need to apply for a visa.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Are there accommodations for students with disabilities?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, UCD has a very detailed structure for students with both physical and learning disabilities. UCD makes an attempt to accommodate every student when possible.For more information, please see the <a href=\"/node/18181\">Safety, Security &amp; Health</a> section of this website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Should I get an International Student ID Card?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We strongly encourage students to purchase ISICs. The card identifies you as a student, making you eligible for reductions on travel fares, museums, theaters, and many other student discounts.&nbsp; The card also carries basic medical and accident insurance, although it may not be used as a substitute for comprehensive health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://travel.state.gov/passport\">U.S. Passports and International Travel</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>How can I sublet my apartment?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many students are concerned about subletting their apartment for the semester they will be off campus.&nbsp; Cornell Abroad offers a subletting forum on their facebook.&nbsp; Anyone is allowed to join this forum and post a sublet.&nbsp; Here is the link for <a href=\"https://www.cuabroad.cornell.edu/\">Cornell Abroad.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How do I start planning?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Your first step is to stop by the Office of Off-Campus Credit Programs in 119 Ives Hall to get more information on the program.&nbsp; The Director and Associate Director of the program can help you to think about courses you might want to take in preparation, and answer any questions you might have. You should also attend one of the info sessions that are held every semester.&nbsp; Keep your grades up!&nbsp; You must have a minimum GPA of 3.0 to participate in this program.&nbsp; Finally, if you do not have a passport, you will need to apply for one no later than six months before you intend to study abroad.&nbsp; Passport processing is extremely slow right now and you may jeopardize your chances of participating in this program if you wait too long!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How do I apply for this program?&nbsp;</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Interested students will meet with the Director and Associate Director of the program to discuss their interests and motivations for participating in this program.&nbsp; Once a determination has been made that the student is prepared and serious about the program, the application will be provided to them.&nbsp; Students may complete either the paper version or the on-line version of the application.&nbsp; All admissions decisions will be made by the Director and Associate Director of Off-Campus Credit Programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How do I get more information?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information, please stop by the Office of Off-Campus Credit Programs in 119 Ives Hall.&nbsp; You should also review this website carefully.&nbsp; We would invite you to review the website of the <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/quinnschool/\">Quinn School of Business at UCD</a> for more general information. You are, of course, also encouraged to attend one of our orientation meetings that are held each semester.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p>Once your son or daughter is in Dublin, s/he may experience some typical adjustment problems or culture shock. All students regardless of their previous travel experience, maturity level, or preparedness may suffer some degree of culture shock. During the early days or weeks of their semester in Dublin, your student may experience periods of frustration, anxiety, and even depression. This is a very common reaction that you should anticipate. Keep in mind, that your student is more likely to call or e-mail during these low moments than when things are going well. This may result in the family having a more negative impression of the situation than actually exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage you to communicate with your student and provide support when needed, but also anticipate these moments and understand them as part of the normal acclimation process. For more information on \"Pointers for Parents,\" we recommend a great article by CIEE, a leading US non-governmental international education organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Before applying, have a serious discussion with your son or daughter about both their academic motivations for participating in this program and their personal preparedness for living abroad.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have an honest conversation about the types of expenses your child anticipates.&nbsp; How much traveling would they like to do?&nbsp; How much financial assistance are you willing to provide for those types of \"extras?\"&nbsp; Also have clear plan on how your student will access money for everyday finances and emergencies.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Contact your bank and credit card companies to let them know your child will be living abroad.&nbsp; You may consider getting ATM limits raised if your child will be using the ATM as their main source for money.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure that your student applies for a passport AT LEAST 3 months before the date of their departure.</li>\r\n\t<li>Review the <a href=\"/node/18246\">Pre-departure Checklist</a> we have provided your child.</li>\r\n\t<li>Read this website thoroughly so you understand the program well.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure that your son or daughter has comprehensive health coverage and has a general physical and dental exam before leaving for Dublin.&nbsp; Also be sure your child has copies of any prescriptions they may be taking before they depart.</li>\r\n\t<li>Buy your student a great guidebook to both Dublin &amp; Ireland.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don't get involved in resolving roommate, social or grading issues.&nbsp; Your student will only learn self-confidence and responsibility if they resolve these issues on their own.</li>\r\n\t<li>Keep emergency contact numbers for your child, the UCD study abroad office, and the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin office.&nbsp; You should also keep a copy of your student's passport in the event it is lost or stolen.</li>\r\n\t<li>Encourage your child to pack lightly!&nbsp; Make them carry their luggage, carry-ons, laptop &amp; purse around the block or up two flights of stairs.&nbsp; If it's too heavy…unpack a few items!&nbsp; Also, research your airlines luggage weight restrictions.&nbsp; Don’t be surprised at the airport by expensive over-weight luggage charges.&nbsp; Most students need half the clothes and twice the money!</li>\r\n\t<li>Help your child make travel arrangements.&nbsp; The cheapest ticket may not always be the best.&nbsp; Be sure to look at lay-over times and the number and timing of connecting flights.&nbsp; International travel is tiring enough without numerous connections and long layovers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Let your student take responsibility for paperwork, deadlines, and orientations associated with studying abroad.&nbsp; This helps them develop a sense of independence and responsibility.&nbsp; If you child has difficulty meeting deadlines or keeping track of paperwork, they may not be mature enough to participate in this program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Give them space!&nbsp; Most students who study abroad experience varying levels of homesickness and cultural adjustment.&nbsp; You should expect this and support them during these times, but give them the opportunity to work through these difficulties.&nbsp; Your student cannot fully immerse themselves in their new environment if they are constantly on the phone with you!</li>\r\n\t<li>Remind them that they are guests in Ireland and they should be respectful of their hosts at all times!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n",

A Cornell transcript will also be generated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European system of grading is significantly different than our own (an A-G scale).&nbsp; Therefore, a conversion scale has been formulated to translate the UCD grades to relevant Cornell grades.&nbsp; Your Cornell transcript will reflect these converted grades. <strong>All converted grades will count toward your Cornell GPA.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ILR Career Services</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Students currently studying abroad will still be eligible to receive all of the services regularly available to students who are on-campus. The process for summer and full-time recruitment is slightly different while you are off campus, so we encourage you to visit the Office of Career Services before you leave campus. For services while you are in Dublin, please contact Melissa Burgess, Assistant Director of Career Services, at <a href=\"mailto:mmb342@cornell.edu\">mmb342@cornell.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<!--<p>The ILR Office of Career Services has also provided us with this helpful list of job search tips for your convenience while off-campus.</p>-->\r\n\r\n<p>We also encourage you to make use of the Cornell Career Services (CCS) office in 103 Barnes Hall. It is a good idea to attend their on-campus recruiting and/or internship orientation sessions before you leave campus. Visit the <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu\">CCS website</a> for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Connecting to the Catherwood Library</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The staff at ILR's Catherwood Library encourages you to visit with them <strong>before</strong> you leave campus so you can be trained on how to maintain access to Cornell information sources from overseas.&nbsp; They can also equip you with a Lexis ID that will work from anywhere in the world. However, if you are not already trained on Lexis (this takes about 1 hour), you can not be supplied with an ID and Password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are already abroad and would like more information on how to access the Catherwood's resources, please look at the following link in the Library Gateway:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://guides.library.cornell.edu/c.php?g=31635&amp;p=200543\">Connecting from off-campus</a>&nbsp;- When in another time zone, it helps if you place your computer clock on Ithaca Date &amp; Time (EST). Some databases require time coordination.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Reference Librarians at the Catherwood Library have put together a great list of <a href=\"/library/research\">research resources</a> for students who are currently off-campus.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Catherwood Library offers numerous guides to help you find appropriate <a href=\"/library/research\">information on the workplace</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li>For contact information, visit the <a href=\"/library/about-catherwood-library/contact-us/department-directory\">Reference Department</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Graduating Seniors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you intend to graduate the semester you return to campus or if you will be spending your final semester in Ireland, please be sure to make an appointment with Ms. Jenn Weidner in the <a href=\"/node/5461\">Office of Student Services</a> to ensure that you have any necessary paperwork done before you leave campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also plan ahead if you would like to be included in the yearbook. If you have questions, please contact the Cornellian at <a href=\"mailto:cornellian@cornell.edu\">cornellian@cornell.edu</a> or by phone at 272-2000 ext. 232. You may also want to visit their offices at 209 College Avenue to schedule a portrait before you leave campus.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions about commencement, contact Jennifer Weidner, College Registrar and Associate Director of Student Services, in&nbsp;101&nbsp;Ives&nbsp;Hall at 607-255-1515 or e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:jlw297@cornell.edu\">jlw297@cornell.edu</a>.&nbsp; You can also get more information on the <a href=\"http://www.commencement.cornell.edu\">Cornell Commencement</a> website.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Withdrawal from the Program</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Withdrawal from the ILR/UCD Program is strictly prohibited except in the case of emergency. You are required to complete your semester, including the entire exam period. You should not make arrangements to leave Dublin until the official closing of the semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should you elect to leave the program early, you risk losing all of your tuition money and the entire semester’s credit. You also would continue to be responsible for fulfilling your housing contract and any other fees associated with the ILR/UCD Semester in Dublin Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Legal Matters</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is essential that you remember that you are a guest in Ireland and you are subject to their legal system. Moreover, you are also subject to all rules, regulations, and procedures of University College, Dublin and Cornell University. If you break Irish law, you will be subject Irish law and may be prosecuted in their criminal system. You are strongly cautioned to strictly obey all Irish laws, particularly drug laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, if you are disciplined by UCD for violations of their regulations, you also risk disciplinary action under the Cornell Code of Conduct. Any disciplinary action taken by UCD will become part of your file at the ILR/UCD Study Abroad Program and the Cornell Judicial Administrator will be notified.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Voting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All registered US voters are eligible to vote by absentee ballot while studying abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to vote in a US election while you are studying in Dublin, you must register to have an absentee ballot sent to you at your local address in Dublin. Every state has slightly different requirements on absentee voting and you should visit the <a href=\"http://www.fvap.gov\">Federal Absentee Voting</a> website for complete information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, follow the guidelines below to ensure that your absentee ballot is counted:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Visit the <a href=\"http://www.fvap.gov\">Federal Voting Assistance Program's</a> website for information on the absentee registration and voting process.</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure that you have applied for your absentee ballot using the hard copy or on-line versions of the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA).</li>\r\n\t<li>Make sure your local election official has your current mailing address.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sign and date all election materials.</li>\r\n\t<li>Fulfill your state's witness/notary requirements (if required).</li>\r\n\t<li>Ensure that your ballot or FPCA is postmarked.</li>\r\n\t<li>Register to vote and request your ballot in a timely manner - not later than September.</li>\r\n\t<li>VOTE - mail your ballot not later than October 15th of the election year.</li>\r\n\t<li>Use the Federal Write in Absentee Ballot if you are overseas and your State absentee ballot does not arrive in time to be mailed back by the state's deadline.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h3>Health Insurance</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Every participant in the ILR Credit Internship Program is required to have comprehensive health insurance that will cover them while interning in either domestic or international locations. Students may seek coverage through their own private health insurance or through the Cornell Student Health Plan (SHP). For more information visit the <a href=\"http://www.studentinsurance.cornell.edu/\">Cornell’s Stu</a><a href=\"https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/health-plans\">dent Benefits </a>website. Please note, you will be charged for a full year’s coverage of this insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cornell Student Health Plan is valid anywhere in the world, but you will need to pay upfront for any medical services. You will need to save your receipts and then submit them for reimbursement. Many private health insurers work in a similar way, but you should contact your individual insurer to confirm details of their requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the event of serious illness or accident, it is very important that you contact the ILR Credit Internship Program office.&nbsp;You can reach Brigid Beachler, Managing Director at (607) 255-2266, or Miguelina Tabar, Program Coordinator at (607) 255-2858. In case of emergency, Ms. Beachler can be reached at home at (607) 277-6438.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each student undertaking an international credit internship is required to complete the ILR Credit Internship Program [[{\"fid\":\"105855\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"link_text\":\"Health Insurance Form\",\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]] and submit it to Brigid Beachler in 119 Ives Hall before leaving for their internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Health Concerns</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Each prospective student should give serious consideration to any health concerns that may affect them while off-campus for the semester. Students should have complete physicals before departing for their internship, whether domestic or international, to ensure that they are in good health. Please note, dental care is relatively expensive in most foreign countries and students are encouraged to get a check up before they leave for an international internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students undertaking international credit internships will likely not qualify for public hospital treatment under the same conditions as citizen of the host country.&nbsp; Therefore, it is <strong>mandatory</strong> that you secure your own private health insurance before leaving for your internship.&nbsp; If you already have health insurance, please be sure to check with your health insurance company that you are covered while abroad.&nbsp; While health care will undoubtedly be available to students, it is very likely that you will have to pay a fee for these services.&nbsp;&nbsp; Comprehensive health insurance coverage will ensure that you are reimbursed for these expenses once you have submitted invoices to your insurance carrier. We encourage those students pursuing international internships to review the <a href=\"https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/requirements/students-studying-abroad\">Students Health Benefits inurance for Students Studying Abroad</a> web page. Semester long insurance is very affordable and will provide full-coverage at the point of service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students pursuing domestic internships should also inquire about their health insurance carriers rules concerning out of network medical coverage and any additional associated costs for such treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you will be bringing any medications with you, carry prescriptions in their original containers. You should also bring a written copy of prescriptions using the generic name for each medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety and Security</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The safety and security of all of our students is a high priority for us. Crime rates in both domestic and international locations, of course, depend on the city in which a student is interning. Most European cities have very low crime rates, however, students should take reasonable precautions to ensure their safety. The most prevalent crime is pick-pocketing and theft. Be <strong>very</strong> aware of your surroundings, do not carry large amounts of cash, and safeguard your passport. Perhaps the biggest key to your safety is <a href=\"https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/internships/credit-internships/about-program/health-safety-security\">personal conduct</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We require that students interning in international locations are covered by a comprehensive health insurance policy. Comprehensive coverage includes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Medically necessary care (NOT just emergency care) while abroad</li>\r\n\t<li>Coverage for pre-existing conditions</li>\r\n\t<li>Coverage in their host country &amp; during any travel you may take outside of their host country</li>\r\n\t<li>Maximum benefit of at least $500,000 per year</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide coverage when you return from the international internship that will cover any conditions contracted abroad</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We further require that students register their travel plans in the <a href=\"https://travelregistry.cornell.edu\">Cornell&nbsp;Travel Registry</a>&nbsp;and print out an International SOS ID&nbsp;insurance card.&nbsp; International SOS is an organization that provides medical evacuation in the event of an emergency. This is a free service provided to each Cornell student. You must have a Cornell net ID and password to login.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an emergency, you must call International SOS as pre-approval is required for medical evacuation. The 24 hour number is (215) 942-8478 or (215)-942-8226 to call collect. You should identify yourself as a Cornell student and provide the Cornell University membership # 11BCSCA827281</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also ask, in the event of an emergency, you contact our office as soon as is reasonable. We can be reached at: (607) 255-2266 or (607) 255-2858 or by email at <a href=\"mailto:bk30@cornell.edu\">bk30@cornell.edu</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"mailto:mt22@cornell.edu\">mt22@cornell.edu</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Even if you are not accepted into your program, the investment in a passport is a good one.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Students who are U.S. citizens must hold a passport in order to travel abroad, and should apply for one immediately if they do not now have one. (Passports that will expire within six months of the end of the program should be renewed before going abroad.)&nbsp; If you begin to apply for a passport after you are accepted to the program you may find you have a difficult time completing all of your paperwork before your departure. Students will need a passport to apply for a visa which is necessary in order to intern in many countries.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>U.S. passports can be obtained or renewed at the <a href=\"http://tompkinscountyny.gov/files2/cclerk/pdfs/pass%20cover2018-03-30%20ADA.pdf\">Tompkins County Clerk's </a>office, 320 North Tioga Street, (607) 274-5431 or the passport agency nearest to your permanent address. Passport agencies and helpful information can be found on the <a href=\"http://passports.state.gov/\">State Department web site</a>. You will need the following documents to apply for or renew a passport:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Completed passport application</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Proof of citizenship (certificate of naturalization, previous passport or a certified copy of your birth certificate)</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Two identical passport photos taken within six months prior to the application</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Personal Identification (driver's license, photo ID or previous passport)</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>The passport application fee is $110. The execution fee is $25. The total is $135. Allow six to eight weeks for delivery. Express processing is available for an additional fee.</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>When you receive the passport, make sure that all of the information on the data page of the passport is accurate and make several photocopies of that page. Give one copy to your parent or guardian, one to Brigid Beachler in the ILR Off-Campus Credit Programs Office and take several copies with you overseas. Be sure to complete the information page on the inside of your passport providing the name, address and telephone number of an emergency contact and sign your passport before you leave for the airport. If your passport is lost in the USA, contact the nearest passport agency or the Department of State. If you lose your passport abroad, notify the nearest consulate or embassy immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>Non-U.S. citizens with U.S. Permanent Residence status may travel to most places, although they may have to complete special visa application procedures. Students who plan to travel on a passport issued by a country other than the U.S. are advised to check visa requirements for all countries they plan to visit. Feel free to speak with ILR’s Office of Off-Campus Credit Programs if you have any questions or concerns.</p>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Faculty members should be chosen after you have decided on the type of internship to be undertaken. Since the Academic Standards Committee requires would-be interns to obtain a faculty member's signature on the application form prior to submission, students will find they usually do not know where they will be interning and cannot, therefore, predict which faculty member is most likely to have expertise in the areas covered by their internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Changing Faculty Supervisors After Internship is Assigned</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you secure a faculty supervisor who turns out to be inappropriate for the final internship assignment, you may change supervisors with the approval of the faculty members involved and the program director. Ideally, this should be done before you begin the internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Changing Faculty Supervisors After Internship is Underway</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is sometimes the case, however, that the intern does not know the focus of the work he/she will be doing until the internship is actually underway. If you find, after beginning your internship, that your faculty supervisor lacks the appropriate expertise to oversee your work, then ask him/her, or the program director, to suggest someone else you might approach if you do not have an alternative supervisor in mind.

In order to make informed choices, you will have to acquaint yourself with the wide (and changing) range of opportunities available to you. Complete listings of available opportunities (organized both geographically and by type or organization), are maintained in the internship office, as well as in the Office of Career Services. These lists are accessed via computer in each location. Moreover, the&nbsp;managing director of the program can provide you with additional information relating to particular internship opportunities, including comments from former ILR interns.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Checking Back Regularly for New Sponsors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the substantial list of opportunities that are routinely available to prospective interns, new sponsors join the program each semester. As a result, it is important that you check the bulletin board outside of&nbsp;119 Ives East frequently to ensure that you are aware of any new internship opportunities that become available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Initial Contact of Sponsors on Your Behalf</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have decided which internship opportunities you wish to pursue, the program director will contact those sponsors on your behalf. In addition to a cover letter explaining your interest in the internship they are offering, the program director will also send to the sponsors your name, a copy of [[{\"fid\":\"10641\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":\"CIP 2\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"file media-element file-default\"}}]], the form on which you explain your reasons for pursuing an internship, and a copy of your resume.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sponsor Decisions and Student Interviews</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, of course, it is the sponsoring organization that decides to whom the offer of its internship is made. Organizations handle the selection process in different ways. Some will send a representative to campus to interview prospective interns, others will request telephone interviews with interested students and others will ask the program director to suggest the names of especially appropriate candidates in accordance with criteria they establish. Sometimes ILR students are in competition with students from other institutions, but more often they are in competition with other ILR students. It's up to you to convince sponsors that you are the person best suited to do the job they have in mind. Whatever the particular procedure you are required to follow, it is extremely important that students seeking internships stay in close contact with the internship office.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Communicating With Potential Sponsors</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To facilitate your search, as well as to minimize its cost to you, a telephone is available for your use in the internship office. You may make internship-related long-distance calls from that telephone as frequently as necessary. In order to influence the timing of the internship selection process, you should be aggressive, but not annoyingly so, in bringing your interest to the attention of those organizations with whom you hope to secure a placement. Remember that your interactions with prospective sponsors are for the purpose of your mutual enlightenment. Be prepared to provide whatever additional information they may require, but also be prepared to solicit whatever additional information you need to make an informed decision about your suitability for the job they have in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Alternative Opportunities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Not every student will get his or her first choice of an internship assignment, but the chances are excellent that you will get one of your top choices. In the event that you want or need to consider additional opportunities beyond those originally selected, you may do so by informing the assistant director.</p>\r\n",

Consequently, it is essential that you proceed with both due deliberation and a full understanding of the personal obligations attendant to the decision you make.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Clarifying the internship conditions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When you do decide to accept an offer, make certain that you have clarified the conditions under which you are accepting the internship: the stipend (if any); the hours; the starting date and the time and place to which you should report; the name of your immediate supervisor; and, the nature of your work assignment. Once you have accepted an assignment, immediately notify the program director. If you still have an application pending with any other organization(s) be sure to inform them that you are no longer available to accept a placement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Forms that must be signed</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>After clarifying the details of your internship, you must read and sign the \"Confidential Information Agreement\" and \"Acceptance of Internship Assignment\" form ([[{\"fid\":\"10651\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":\"CIP 4\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"file media-element file-default\"}}]]).

The course meets once a week; interns will receive a letter shortly before the term begins giving the time and place of the first class meeting. The course serves two purposes: in addition to providing instruction relating to aspects of the field, it provides interns with an opportunity to share their internship experiences and to learn from each other. The professors teaching the courses are also available for discussion about internship work and associated problems.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>The Internship Job Site and Your Performance</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>The major portion of the intern's time will be spent at the internship site carrying out projects assigned by the site supervisor. Interns are expected to work to the standards of the sponsoring organization, recognizing that their behavior reflects not only on themselves but on the ILR School as well, and that less than satisfactory performance could result both in that internship being discontinued and in an unsatisfactory grade for the 8 credit work component of the internship.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Interns will be formally evaluated twice during the semester, and these evaluations will be forwarded to your ILR faculty supervisor.&nbsp; Your faculty supervisor will use these evaluations as a significant factor in your final grade for the semester.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Required Independent Study Project</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Each intern is also responsible for the completion of a 4-credit independent study project related to the internship assignment. The nature of the project is determined by the intern and his/her faculty supervisor. The specifics of the project must be set forth in the \"Internship Project Plan\" form ([[{\"fid\":\"10661\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":\"CIP 6\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"file media-element file-default\"}}]]), which is to be signed by both the intern and the faculty supervisor. Since it is often not possible to work out a detailed plan in advance, submission of the formal plan may be delayed until the fourth week of the internship if necessary. Care should be taken in completing this form since it is a written record of the agreement detailing the academic work to be done and the basis upon which it is to be evaluated.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<h3>Stay in Touch!</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>As previously explained, it is the responsibility of each intern to initiate and maintain necessary communication with his/her faculty supervisor throughout the term of the internship.</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h3>An Educational Experience, Not Just A Job</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since academic credit is granted for the successful completion of the internship, sponsoring organizations must agree to make the internship an educational experience and not just a job. Simply stated, this means that you will be asked to complete assignments which, while they may draw upon past education and experience, take you into new areas, providing opportunities for testing and growth under the guidance of an experienced professional. The assignment must involve appropriate professional responsibility in an area of ILR-related activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where Descriptions Are Available</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Potential sponsors are asked to develop a description of the proposed internship assignment which must be approved by the&nbsp;managing director&nbsp; before an intern can be placed with the organization. Descriptions of approved internship opportunities currently available to ILR students are accessible in the internship office,&nbsp;119&nbsp;or&nbsp;124&nbsp;Ives&nbsp;Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Monetary Stipends</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many internships offer a monetary stipend. Because you are compensated in the form of academic credit, and because the internship program is an educational rather than an employment program, the School does not require that sponsors offer a stipend. Therefore, a stipend should be regarded as a bonus, and should not, in most cases, be the determining factor in your decision to pursue a specific opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Internships Initiated By Students</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;managing director also seeks out additional internship opportunities each semester to accommodate special interests that students may have. It is also possible for students to take the initiative in identifying an appropriate opportunity, although all sponsors and assignments must be approved by the&nbsp;managing director. Students choosing to follow this route should seek guidance from the&nbsp;managing director at an early stage in the procedure.</p>\r\n",

Interns may, however, avail themselves of useful advice in this regard by consulting with the internship program's managing director and by finding out from current and former interns how they found suitable housing in the same internship location. Prospective interns will be provided with the names and contact information for those students who have most recently interned in the same location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Washington, D.C. interns have often arranged to live in the building that houses the Cornell in Washington Program (CIW).&nbsp; This space, when it is available, is on a first come, first served basis.&nbsp; To find out if the CIW&nbsp; is likely to have excess space available for the term of your internship, you should contact CIW's on-campus office in&nbsp;300 Kennedy&nbsp;Hall,&nbsp;607-255-4090, or email <a href=\"mailto:cwash@cornell.edu\">cwash@cornell.edu</a>.&nbsp; They maintain a waiting list for non-CIW students, although it is often late in the process before they can tell you whether or not space will be available for the coming semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In New York City (another popular site for internships), housing may also become a special source of concern, although, once again, the internship program's managing director may be in a position to offer useful advice, including information relating to college and university housing in the area.&nbsp; A popular housing option for ILR interns in NYC is the 92Y Residence.&nbsp; For more information on this facility,&nbsp;follow the <a href=\"http://www.92y.org/Uptown/92YResidence-Student-Intern-Housing/Booking-a-Room.aspx\">92Y Residence</a>&nbsp;link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, for students with internships located in other parts of the region or the country, sponsors are sometimes in a position to offer assistance in finding suitable housing.

Admission to the various research facilities of the library is free. No introduction or credentials are required for persons over high school age who wish to read in the general reading rooms; however, certain collections, like those of the Manuscript, Rare Book and Special Collections, and Motion Picture Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Divisions, can be used only by those with a serious purpose for doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Department of Labor Library</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Location: Room N2439 Frances Perkins Bldg., 200 Constitution Avenue, NW<br>\r\n\tHours: Mon - Fri: 8:15 am - 4:45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labor-Management Services Administration maintains two Public Documents Rooms. Reports filed under WPPDA and ERISA provisions are available for public viewing in Room N4677, while LMRDA reports may be viewed in Room N5616.&nbsp; Only Department of Labor Employees may take out materials unless an individual has an interlibrary loan request from another library.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Gelman Library</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Location: George Washington University, 2130 H Street, NW<br>\r\n\tHours: Mon - Thurs: 8:30 am - midnight, Fri: 8:30 am - 10:00 pm,<br>\r\n\tSat: 10:00 a.m. - 10:00 p.m, Sun: 10:00 am - midnight</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-George Washington students must have a pass which will allow them to use the materials in the library but not give them borrowing privileges. To obtain a pass, go to the circulation desk and explain your situation -- that you are an intern for the semester and that you need to use the library to complete research in connection with your internship. Although issuance of the pass is not automatic, your chances of getting one are pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>New York City</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5>New York Public Library</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Location: 5th Avenue and 42nd Street</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In New York City, the obvious choice is the New York Public Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>ILR Extension Office Library</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Location: 16 East 34th Street, 4th floor<br>\r\n\tHours: Mon - Thurs: 2:00pm - 8:00pm, Sun: 9:00am - 1:00pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This library has significant EEO and Industrial Relations collections and the capacity to tap into the BNA Services and Catherwood Library collection via computer. (212) 340-2845.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Wagner Archives of the Tamiment Institute at NYU</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Location: 70 Washington Square, South<br>\r\n\tHours: Mon - Fri: 10:00 am - 5:45 pm</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holdings are much like those of the ILR School's Labor-Management Documentation Center, but focused mainly on New York City.

Please visit <a href=\"http://oanda.com/convert/classic\">this site for a currency converter</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Billing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All students participating in the ILR Credit Internship Program will continue to pay ILR tuition at the same in-state or out-of-state rate as they do when in residence at the Ithaca campus, and your ILR tuition will continue to be billed directly by Cornell University.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Financial Aid</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you currently receive financial aid, you will continue to receive that financial aid while you are off campus!&nbsp; Financial Aid can be used for all relevant expenses related to your internship including: tuition, housing, meals, personal expenses, books, and (non-tourist related) airfare if necessary.&nbsp; In some instances, you may receive increased financial aid packages depending on the location of your internship.&nbsp; The ILR Credit Internship Program has worked closely with the Office of Financial Aid to create accurate budgets for our international locations that more fully reflect the increased costs of participating in an internship abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR Credit Internship Program is not, however, privy to individual financial aid packages and specific questions about your situation should be directed to the <a href=\"http://finaid.cornell.edu/\">Office of Financial Aid</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you receive Federal Work Study support, this aid will be converted to student loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not currently receive financial aid, but think you might be eligible given the additional expenses of undertaking a credit internship, you should contact an advisor in the Office of Financial Aid well in advance of the semester you elect to participate in the program to discuss this possibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To receive refunds once you have left for your internship, the <a href=\"http://finaid.cornell.edu/\">Office of Financial Aid</a> recommends that you sign up for Direct Deposit through the Cornell Bursar. Checks will be directly deposited into the bank account you have specified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The NMB performs a key role in achieving the principal purpose of the Act: “to avoid any interruption in commerce or to the operation of any carrier engaged therein” by assisting the carriers and their employees in their duty under the Act to “exert every reasonable effort” to settle disputes. The Board’s principal statutory goals are:<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n\t1) To facilitate the resolution of disputes in the negotiation of new or revised collective bargaining agreements;<br>\r\n\t2) To insure employee rights of self-organization, without interference, when representation disputes exist, and;<br>\r\n\t3) To provide for the prompt and orderly settlement of disputes growing out of minor disputes or out of the interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Organization Background: CSX Corporation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>CSX Corporation, together with its subsidiaries based in Jacksonville, FL, is one of the nation's leading transportation suppliers and is one of the four Class I Railroads in the United States. The company’s rail and intermodal businesses provide rail-based transportation services including traditional rail service and the transport of intermodal containers and trailers. CSX currently employs over 30,000 employees who fill a variety of management and union positions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the CSX Transportation network encompasses about 21,000 route miles of track in 23 states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Our transportation network serves some of the largest population centers in the nation. More than two-thirds of Americans live within CSX’s service territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CSX serves major markets in the eastern United States and has direct access to all Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports, as well as the Mississippi River, the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. The company also has access to Pacific ports through alliances with western railroads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CSX moves a broad portfolio of products across the country in a way that minimizes the effect on the environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system, and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labor Relations has about 60 employees (management and union) and is tasked with maintaining relationships with 13 labor organizations in an effort to facilitate favorable operations between those organizations and CSX as a carrier.&nbsp; CSX employs 27,000 unionized employees, and the degree of union density is greater than 98% of all employees who are eligible for unionization.&nbsp; Typical responsibilities include claims management/data analysis, discipline, seniority bulletins, arbitration, agreement interpretation, providing guidance to field managers, and brief writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Internship Description:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Interns can expect to share their onsite time between CSX and the NMB (and potentially a union organization), to the extent required to fulfill credits required for the internship semester (e.g., estimated 7 weeks at CSX [compensated] and a union organization, with additional time split with the NMB [uncompensated]).&nbsp; At CSX, interns can expect to gain arbitration experience, participate in the analysis and preparation of case briefings, job-shadow LR managers on daily job duties which will include conferences with union leadership, analyze claim data and create reports, and develop training content for field managers based on scenarios in real claims.&nbsp; At the NMB, interns can expect to participate in a variety of activities that involve mediation and conflict resolution between carriers and organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Skills:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Analytical thinking capability, strong verbal and written communication skills, professional demeanor, strong teamwork skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Areas of Knowledge:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Labor agreements, history of unions/labor movement in America, discipline handling and arbitration procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stipend:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Available for time at CSX&nbsp; $600 per week, plus a travel allowance of up to $2,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Application process:</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>CSX and the NMB would invite Cornell to proceed with the normal intern selections process in-house, and then forwarding on a ‘short list’ of candidates for phone interviews and additional fit assessment for the position by the CSX LR and NMB onsite teams.</p>\r\n",

This combined use of local participation in planning with the utilization of locally available skills, technology, materials, and appropriate work methods has proven to be an effective and economically viable approach to infrastructure works in developing countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of infrastructure in providing access to basic services and promoting development is widely understood. Half of public investments in most developing countries is in infrastructure, and in many cases, over 50 per cent of this investment (rising to as much as 80 or 90 per cent in the least developed countries), is funded by external donors. The impact of these investments in infrastructure can be greatly increased, however, through a local level planning process that identifies appropriate interventions based on the needs of local communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise, the employment potential of these infrastructure investments is vast, but is often not realized, as many projects are equipment-intensive, frequently using foreign contractors. This may be necessary for airports, motorways or heavy bridges, but employment-intensive alternatives using labour-based technologies are available for more basic infrastructure, offering major advantages in terms of using infrastructure investments to create local employment and incomes, as well as skills and capacities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EIIP uses the infrastructure project cycle as a means of realizing its objectives of employment creation, local participation and resource use, and the promotion of good governance: starting with local level planning, through implementation using labour-based technologies and small scale contracting, and ending with appropriate maintenance. All these stages of the project cycle form suitable entry points for promoting the employment intensive investment approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/recon/eiip\">Please visit the Employment Intensive Investment Programme website »</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intern responsibilities would include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Desk Review of ILO EIIP Impact Studies\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>all the reports listed in Annex</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>EIIP project evaluation reports</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>literature and methodologies on environmental impact studies</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>literature and studies on employment elasticises different economic sectors and relative employment impact of sectoral investments</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Assess availability of data</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Data availability will be assessed from both macro- (top-down) and micro- (bottom-up) perspectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the macro- perspective, the consultant will look at comparative data on contributions of different economic sectors and sub-sectors to GDP and to employment creation, data on public and private investment by economic sector as well data on the impact of public investment budgets to job creation. A key element of this work will be developing reliable methods to assess infrastructure components of national budgets and accounts and of different economic sectors. This data review will assess the availability of such data in comparable form, availability of data on investments in infrastructure broken down by categories such as roads, irrigation, drainage, water supply, afforestation, etc.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h3>BSILR '14<br>\r\n\tGE Energy, MN</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>During the summer and fall of 2012, I worked as a Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) intern for GE Energy. My time at GE was extremely rewarding, and I am confident that it will serve as a worthy building block for future professional endeavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Workforce Planning aligns human capital analytics with the broader business strategy. It enables a business to efficiently achieve its financial goals by acquiring and placing mission critical talent at the right time and place. GE, whose HR expertise is globally recognized, is at the forefront of applying, refining, and reaping SWP's benefits. I worked on several high impact projects shaping GE's immediate and longer-term future. One of my projects involved managing an advanced workforce-modeling software with a vendor. Another comprised of analyzing talent markets in order to suggest where a new business should locate to attract and retain desired talent. These and other projects complemented my ILR coursework, allowed me to develop new technical skills, and really stretched me to examine the impact of decisions from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the work I did was self-guided, and I really appreciated the autonomy and freedom to accomplish many tasks wholly on my own. However, my ability to execute those projects would not have been possible without my supervisor. He was a wonderful mentor, and instrumental in easing my transition from the ILR School to industry. I am deeply grateful for the trust and guidance I received from him. His strong consulting background and SWP expertise were especially of great benefit to me. My supervisor continually introduced me to key business concepts, articles, and other resources related to my work. Many brainstorming sessions with him taught me how to maximize impact by shifting priorities; these sessions enhanced my ability to navigate ambiguity, draw insight from incomplete data, and deliver high quality results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also had several opportunities to present my work to senior leadership. During my final presentation to the Global HR Shared Services leader at GE Corporate and her staff, I learned that GE is in the course of further developing the initiatives that I helped lay the foundation for. It was rewarding to see the impact of my work, and I am looking forward to seeing GE's continued innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All employees were encouraged to serve the surrounding community at GE, and I had fun participating in those activities with the other interns. We served refreshments to participants in a Habitat for Humanity charity bike ride, and also assembled backpacks filled with school supplies for youth in the inner city. GE sponsored us for a few events as well, such as going out to lunch with our supervisors, cheering on the Minnesota Twins (to victory!), and having a movie night out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My internship was a fantastic experience and is definitely a highlight of my ILR education. I highly encourage students to spend a semester broadening their expertise through a Credit Internship. I have come away with a much greater appreciation for my ILR education, and gained invaluable skills and perspectives that I will continue to develop throughout my future professional career.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- Heidi Wong</blockquote>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h3>BSILR '14<br>\r\n\tHBO, New York City</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This semester, as a junior in ILR, I had the incredible opportunity of interning for HBO. Upon seeing their need for a human resources intern, I eagerly jumped at the chance. I couldn’t wait to use my coursework and prior internship experience to help HBO’s talent acquisition team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My experience was primarily with their talent acquisition team helping to recruit for their summer internship program. My supervisor was adamant about exposing me to all aspects of recruitment, and I learned how to conduct phone and on-site interviews and assess the match of a candidate to our program. This was the most important aspect of the internship experience for me, because I became comfortable interacting with candidates on a one-on-one level. This allowed me to picture myself as a recruiter in the future and also see the recruiting process from the recruiter’s side rather than the candidate’s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, I was exposed to all aspects of their talent acquisition process, including recruitment of full-time candidates and on-boarding procedures. I completed offer packages, background checks, and reference checks. This hands-on learning experience complemented my ILR education perfectly and gave me a complete understanding of everything I had learned in class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balancing this work with my work on the internship program taught me how to multi-task and work in a large corporate environment. These skills are incredibly necessary to excel in any business environment, and I now feel confident in my ability to work on various projects and meet all appropriate deadlines upon my graduation from ILR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would whole-heartedly recommend the Credit Internship Program, and specifically an internship at HBO, to all students interested in pursuing a career in a corporate environment. The experience has helped demonstrate to me just how valuable my ILR education is and how equipped I am to use it going forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- Michelle A Birnbach</blockquote>\r\n",

Employers interviewing through ILR Career Services in Ives Hall seek candidates who have training in ILR-specific fields—such as Human Resources Management, Labor Relations or Human Resources Consulting—for full-time jobs and summer internships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial service institutions, retailers, non-profit organizations, and other employers who are seeking graduates across a wider range of majors and degrees generally schedule their on-campus visits through Cornell Career Services (CCS). These interviews take place in Barnes Hall or at the Statler Hotel. You can gain access to all of these jobs by registering for our on-line system, <a href=\"https://cornell.joinhandshake.com/\">Handshake </a>and look for posting with interview schedules and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/index.cfm\">use the On-Campus Recruiting </a>link. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/upload/OCR_Tutorial_2012_New.htm\">Cornell Career Services On-Campus Recruiting Tutorial</a> provides complete information on using the on-campus recruiting component of Handshake. This tutorial was designed to give you a thorough introduction to on-campus recruiting and to inform you of our expectations for your conduct while recruiting. Completion of the tutorial is required for you to be eligible to participate in on-campus recruiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By registering with Handshake you agree to abide by CCS's <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/policies.cfm\">On-Campus Recruiting Policy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Preparing for On-Campus Interviewing</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have access to Handshake, you’ll need to complete a brief career interest profile. If you would like help in completing this, we have a <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/upload/OCR_Profile_New.htm\">tutorial</a> specifically for the profile as well. This should help you learn how to enter your information to get the most out of our system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All students who plan to participate in ILR on-campus recruiting should additionally,</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>obtain a copy of the Career Guide</li>\r\n\t<li>prepare a résumé and cover letter and have them reviewed by ILR OCS</li>\r\n\t<li>schedule a practice interview (mandatory for participating in on-campus recruiting)</li>\r\n\t<li>attend the ILR Career Fair in the fall semester</li>\r\n\t<li>attend employer presentations throughout the recruiting season</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cancelling Interviews and \"No-Shows\"</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornell Career Services and the ILR Office of Career Services expect that students will attend every interview they schedule. If you cannot attend, or if you elect to cancel an interview, you must notify our office by phone (607-255-7816), e-mail (ilrrecruiting@cornell.edu), or in person (201 Ives Hall) no later than 9:00 a.m. on the business day prior to your interview. Failure to honor an interview appointment that you have scheduled, without this notice of cancellation, is called a \"no-show\" and is considered to be a serious breach of courtesy and ethics. The Cornell Career Services Recruiting Policy is available online and is posted in our office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First no-show: requires a written explanation to the recruiter within three (3) business days and a meeting with a member of the OCS staff before the student may continue using on-campus recruiting.<br>\r\n\tStudents must bring two copies of the apology letter and a stamped, addressed envelope. OCS staff will mail the letter to the recruiter and keep the second copy on file.<br>\r\n\tSecond no-show: requires the letter of apology, and will result in forfeiture of future interviews scheduled through Handshake for a determined length of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Integrity in the Job Search</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>All personal information that you present during the job search (in your résumé and cover letters, in your Handshake Profile, during interviews, etc.) must be completely accurate. Falsifying information is considered unethical behavior and will lead to the removal of your on-campus recruiting privileges. If discovered after you have received a job offer, that offer will most likely be retracted.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h4>What is an on-site interview?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>An on-campus, telephone, or first-round interview is generally for the purpose of screening applicants. If you make it past this selection level, you'll be invited for an on-site interview, or an in-person visit to the location where the job is or sometimes to corporate headquarters. The decision to hire usually rests with the supervisor in whose department the opening exists, or with input from departments that work with the program you're being considered for, so your performance in the site visit is critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>How is the on-site interview scheduled?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most employers bring all their candidates to the site on a specific date, although some offer flexibility in the selection of the date. Be mindful of your academic schedule. Be sure to check with your professors to make sure you can make up the work you may miss in class. Otherwise, you may jeopardize your grade in the given class or classes. If you experience a conflict with a class, please see a <a href=\"/node/5411\">staff member</a> in ILR OCS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not ask an employer to speak with a professor on your behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Will the on-site interview cost me anything?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most organizations pay expenses for travel, lodging, and meals. If it is not clear that this is the case, ask for clarification. The employer may send you a cash advance to cover predictable expenses, or reimburse you either at the end of your interviewing day or within two or three weeks following your interview. Keep accurate records of your expenses, including mileage (if you drive to the interview), hotel bills, airline or train tickets, meal receipts, and taxi fares. You should feel free to discuss any monetary or travel concerns with a <a href=\"/node/5411\">staff member</a> in OCS.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What will the schedule for the on-site interview be like?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may undergo anywhere from four to fourteen separate interviews in ONE day! Some organizations set up a full day of half-hour interviews with people from human resources, supervisors in the department(s) where openings exist, middle-level managers, other employees, etc. Other organizations limit the number of interviews to five or six individuals who are directly related to the particular opening. Be prepared for varied interviewing styles. Keep in mind that the three most crucial interviewers you will see are the hiring manager, your future supervisors, and your supervisor's supervisor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, the day begins with a meeting at which you will be given an overview of the day and the names and titles of the individuals with whom you will be meeting. Either during this meeting or at the end of the day you will receive general information about benefits, the organization, and the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A meal or reception may be part of the schedule that seems more like a social event to you than an interview. Regardless of how it seems, it's still an interview so be very careful to maintain your professional behavior! Before you order a meal, think about how easy the dish will be to eat while you're conversing with others. In a reception setting, don't latch on to any one person; talk to others and mingle around the group. Don't drink too much alcohol (and don't drink any if you're not of age!), as you may let down your guard inappropriately or demonstrate that you don't take work seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What are they looking for?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>During these interviews you will be assessed in three general areas: technical expertise, personal attributes, and level of maturity and organizational 'fit.' You probably will not have answered questions designed to test your technical expertise at your on-campus interview. During the second interview, however, you will be speaking with individuals with specialized knowledge, so you should be fairly well prepared to discuss the particular activity for which you're being considered. Some organizations arrange for candidates to have lunch with a group of younger employees or young alumni. Keep in mind that these people are not there as your friends (even if you knew them when they were at Cornell) but are representatives of the organization; they are in a position to evaluate you. Don't give in to the temptation to let down and relax. Instead, ask questions to find out how their perceptions of the&nbsp;organization and how they have progressed within it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What happens at the end of the visit?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day you will probably return to the human resources office (or potential supervisor) for a discussion of how your day went and information about when you might expect to hear from them. Don't ask about salary at this point. Wait for an offer to discuss salary. After you return from your trip, write individual thank-you notes or e-mails to the people with whom you met. If there is additional information about yourself that you want to get across, include it in one or more of these letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What general advice can you offer?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing to do for second interviews (as for all others) is your homework. Research the organization more extensively than by merely reading the recruiting literature. Check the New York Times Index for recent news items; talk with faculty members who may have had some contact with the organization; find out the names and addresses of recent alums who work with the organization and call them to get additional insight. Use the <a href=\"http://guides.library.cornell.edu/careers\">Cornell University Library</a> resources on researching organizations and industries. The more prepared you are, the better impression you will make and the better able you will be to decide whether or not this is the right job for you. Be prepared with lots of questions about the organization, its position in its sector, the culture there, new ventures, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be interviewed by several different people, so you are likely to be asked some of the same questions over and over again. You should answer the questions in full and with enthusiasm each time, even though you feel you are repeating yourself. Interviewers may or may not dig deeper into your résumé, but review it and familiarize yourself once again with the details of your accomplishments. If you think that important information about you is not being elicited, take the responsibility of getting that information across.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>What about ethical behavior in on-site interviews?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Only accept 2nd-round interviews with organizations in which you are sincerely interested in. Do not accept if there is a chance you will cancel the on-site interview. Organizations who make flight arrangements on your behalf must bear the cost of flight changes or cancellations!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do need to cancel, give ample notice. Cancelling a few days or even a week ahead of time is not considered sufficient notice and puts the good reputation of the ILR School at risk with the employer.</p>\r\n",

It was an unforgettable semester, one that I will always remember not only as a part of my college career, but as an important part of my own life’s development. I remember talking to many students before me who had studied abroad in Australia and everyone had described Australia as a “magical” place where the sun soaked weather provided a friendly and relaxed environment. I was certainly able to experience this magic firsthand through my 5 months as an exchange student, waking up every day to gorgeous weather and a genuine happiness that only this land could provide. I would really like to thank Brooke and Glenn Grindlinger for the grant that allowed me to travel across Australia and to create such incredible adventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studying at the University of New South Wales was an enriching experience and served to complement my ILR classes back at Cornell. The international nature of the school helped me receive exposure to many different cultures and a diverse set of views. My class, “Managing Across Cultures” was composed of students from all across the world and I was able to work in several group projects with them. I was able to interact with Australian students throughout my classes, while appreciating a wide array of their perspectives. I also learned more about the Australian political system and different Australian labor practices, especially through my unique lens of an ILR student. Another meaningful perspective was provided through my “Brand Marketing” class which explored both Australian and American marketing strategies and their respective consumer behavior. As someone with a career interest in entrepreneurship, I appreciated this unique chance to learn about another country’s market both in class and through firsthand experience of living in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I lived across from a beach, as my Cornell friends and I settled in a house conveniently located in the suburb of Coogee, NSW. It was extremely exciting to begin every day when we were only a minute walk to the waves. Our balcony also overlooked a Rugby field, a sport that Australians absolutely lived for and one that I became fascinated by. I vividly remember sitting front row at a Wallabies vs. All Blacks game for one of the biggest rugby games of the year. The small beach town of Coogee was the perfect place to live, with outdoor restaurants, beach shops, and all kinds of visitors coming to relax. Instead of playing in the snow at Cornell, I was able to hang out in the waves of the beautiful Australian beaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I truly appreciate the Grindlinger award for helping me fully experience Australia, especially through my unforgettable journeys across the country. I was able to snorkel the Great Barrier Reef, explore the wonderful culture filled city of Melbourne, experience the bustling life of Sydney, climb Kangaroo Cliff in Brisbane, and relax in the Gold Coast. It was an incredibly valuable experience as a first semester senior, as one day I was on a boat snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef, and then later in the week I was pre-enrolling for my last semester’s classes. People have always asked me if I had any second thoughts about going to Australia as a Senior. Yes, and they’ve always been exactly the same as my first thoughts, “this is going to be awesome!”</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- Matthew Joe, Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</blockquote>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h2>Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>UNSW, Sydney, Australia,&nbsp;Fall 2013</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Grindlinger for your generous grant towards my study in Australia. As an exchange student at the University of New South Wales, I completed courses toward my ILR degree that spanned across the UNSW Law and Business schools. Moreover, I explored a continent that would come to enhance my life and learning in general. In hindsight, I cannot overstate my appreciation for the opportunity to discover and eventually fall in love with the most beautiful place on Earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economics and compensation courses grounded me in Australian business and workplace studies, providing the familiar ILR coursework I was expecting from an Exchange program, while finance and religion classes allowed me to pursue other academic interests and receive elective credit. The professors took a more globally oriented approach to teaching, which made the material easy to understand and apply. The UNSW campus is open and inviting, providing the option to study outside with Aussies or the hundreds of other exchange students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My greatest experiences and lessons took place outside the classroom. Living off campus in the Coogee Beach community gave me the archetypal “Australian” experience, where I tried to surf and discovered the coastal walk to the world-famous Bondi Beach was more fitting. Living with other exchange students and chatting with native Sydneysiders gave me insight into how rich of a culture I was so eager to embrace. I could quickly adjust to walking on the “wrong” side of the sidewalk, or calling McDonald’s, “Macca’s”, and proceed to take advantage of all things distinctly Australian. It felt surreal to hug a kangaroo and see a live Tasmanian devil, or see little penguins march from the Arctic Ocean onto the shores of Phillip’s Island in Southern Australia. As I watched The Melbourne Cup at a pub or rooted for the home team in the famous Australia-New Zealand rugby match, I grew more comfortable with calling the land down under “home”. Studying in Sydney made a Spring Break trip to South East Asia possible, where I had unforgettable experiences in Thailand and Singapore before returning to Sydney to complete finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the free time I had and free spirits I was surrounded by during my semester exchange, I was able to contribute a new perspective to the classroom at Cornell. I am now able to analyze discussion topics in more depth by considering the lifestyle and viewpoints of citizens across the globe. I cannot be more thankful for this invaluable skill I inherited from my time in Australia. I would like to thank the Grindlinger’s once more for helping make my dream of learning in a place so magical, a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- Deanna Hall, Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</blockquote>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h2>Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>UNSW, Sydney, Australia,&nbsp;Spring 2013</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I came to Cornell to study at the ILR School with interests in educational cooperation and reform that remarkably resemble my career interests today. Even with that continuity, I like many of my fellow seniors considered myself unsure about the future. Unlike most seniors, however, I made the choice to work through my professional misgivings far from the Hill by studying abroad this spring, my final semester as an undergraduate. Studying abroad in Australia poses several challenges, most all of which were dramatized by my status as a second semester senior. The financial support of the Grindlinger Award allowed me to combat these challenges and also explore my career interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have a strong background in international educational research, but with so much to know about and so many changes occurring in education, I was eager to learn about schools and government in Australia. To do this I undertook three main activities. First, I undertook an independent study through the ILR School on how the Australian education system developed and how it influenced classism. I poured over many books and was lucky enough to engage in many thoughtful conversations with UNSW professors on this subject. This research would have been far more difficult back at Cornell where interest and knowledge about Australia is understandably limited among professors and books on the country’s education system are far more difficult to come by. My next two activities would have been entirely impossible outside of an abroad experience. With the help of the UNSW Study Abroad Office I began to volunteer at a local public school while abroad in Sydney. At South Coogee Public I was able to observe and assist in two kindergarten classrooms during their reading lessons. This weekly experience helped me reflect upon how the diversity and density of Australia’s urban areas differ from those of other cities I am familiar with, like New York City and London. I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the students (and seeing their adorable school uniforms) and seeing how the teachers utilized parent help and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, being in Sydney for an extended period allowed me to achieve one of my main goals for my semester, to connect with a teachers union in Australia. The NSW Teachers Federation allowed me to visit their headquarters and discuss openly with several staff members. This experience mirrored one that I had in London with the NUT, the largest teachers union in the UK. Just like in London, I asked these trade unionists about their relationships with political parties and about marketization of education. In addition, I was able to tour the Department of Education in downtown Sydney, a great experience considering I had just interned for the American Department of Education during Cornell’s winter recess. By speaking personally with Australians involved in education I got far more than I ever had from reading Australian newspaper articles and blog posts previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I cannot emphasize enough how important the Grindlinger Foundation Award was to my decision to go abroad. Without the financial security it offered I would have considered my going abroad too large a burden to place on my parents, who had just been highly affected by Hurricane Sandy. Without the impetus of the Grindlinger Award I may have never uncovered the links between my past research on changes to education in the UK and USA and changes occurring in Australia. I also certainly would not have spent an entire semester pouring over books on the history of the Australian education system in an effort to fulfill a graduation requirement. Most significant to my family, without the support of the Grindlinger Award I would not have been able have gained all of these experiences and also returned to the United States in time to walk at my graduation ceremony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before embarking on my semester abroad at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, I received an email from a professor offering his regards and his hopes that I would find solace and growth in the experience. I am happy to report that I found both of these things, in addition to an enhanced sense of self-confidence. Thanks to correspondence with teacher unions and public workers in Sydney, I will even return home with a better understanding of the complexities behind macro-level changes occurring presently in education internationally and a desire to learn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- Chyanne Eyde, Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</blockquote>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h2>Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exchange Student at UNSW, Sydney, Australia,&nbsp;Fall 2012</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>My experience in Australia has been, by far, the most significant time I have spent in my life. I [Michelle Kizer in Australia!] had several opportunities to enrich my ILR education at the University of New South Wales, learn more about where I may fit in the professional world, and experience exponential personal growth and awareness of myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At UNSW, I received a credit and three distinctions for classes in workplace training, pay and performance, strategic HRM and negotiation. Overall, the courses have provided what I identify as key HR skills and knowledge necessary to enter an entry-level generalist position. They have been a great complement to the numerous ILR classes I have taken on labor relations. Further, the teaching of such material through an Australian lens has given me the international labor perspective I favor learning about in my ILR coursework. Perhaps the most distinct difference I learned about was the approach to training. Falling along a continuum between voluntarist and regularist systems, the Australian training system requires various registered training providers to adhere to a set of criteria while providing training for people. Of course, no system is flawless, but this is a step towards ensuring that people who receive a specified level of training have the same set of qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a result of the coursework I took at UNSW, I am more certain of my future in HR. I was very much fascinated by the process of creating a strong training program that adequately addresses business needs, and am considering becoming a training provider. More generally, learning about the differences between American and Australian labor processes makes me strongly consider pursuing a doctoral program in international labor. Thus, if I do not take an active HR role in my career, I will still remain informed through research on Australian HR practices and labor processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps the most growth has been in my personal life. It was liberating to indulge in another culture in Sydney. My return back to the States has revealed the extent of my assimilation; from ordering chips with tomato sauce to allowing all cars to pass before I cross the street, my mind and mannerisms are still very much in Australia. Through being in a new place, I have become more attracted to learning about different cultures. I have learned the stories of so many travelers and Australians who have become close friends. These interactions also extended my sociability skills; upon returning to Ives, I have stopped to make friends with new people and rekindle otherwise baseline friendships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, the Grindlinger scholarship has supported traveling to places I never imagined I could see. I swam in the Great Barrier Reef (and have a scar to prove it), skydived over Sydney, danced with a Santa flash mob around Christmastime in Melbourne, visited the most easternly point of Australia in Byron Bay, and soaked in sun in Gold Coast. With each new experience I have realized the fragility of life, and feel compelled to live a life that is balanced with happiness and purpose. Perhaps the Australian cultural values of balancing work with leisure (or fearing death from slipping off of Cradle Mountain in Tasmania) has taught me that life is short, and should be enjoyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sincerely thank Brooke and Glenn Grindlinger for providing funds to support my adventures down under. I would neither have been able to see all that I have seen, nor receive the necessary direction as to where I may consider focusing my HR career. My semester abroad has truly been an amazing experience, and I plan to return back to Australia to once more surround myself with people who have a zest for life, and engage on a deeper cultural level than before.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>- Michelle Kizer, Brooke &amp; Glenn Grindlinger Award Report</blockquote>\r\n",

Alumni are engaged in the work of ILR in meaningful ways by offering advice to deans and faculty, hosting ILR student interns, recruiting graduating seniors, guest lecturing in courses, sharing career insights as panelists, hosting alumni networking events, and as loyal donors whose contributions advance ILR. The ILR Office of Alumni Affairs and Development helps facilitate activities like those described above and drives fundraising activity for the ILR School.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p><strong>Career field: </strong>Nonprofit<br>\r\n\t\t<strong>Location: </strong>Ithaca, NY<br>\r\n\t\t<strong>On site or remote:</strong> Student may work on site or remotely<br>\r\n\t\t<strong>Job opportunity: </strong>WISP Project DescriptionAnnual Fund Project Approximate time commitment (10hrs/week)The intern will assist Haley Singer with an audience segmentation project based on prior giving from alumni, parents and friends of ILR, and other categories such as high potential lapsed donors, and prospective donors highly advanced in their fields. This can be informed by the Cornell Annual Fund levels already assigned, but would involve more expansive reporting analysis and with an eye toward ILR specific engagement. Once appropriate segments are established, the intern will work with the populations in these segments, and potentially career or degree focused sub-segments, using high impact mass communication, videos, etc. likely to facilitate interest in ILR. In the highest segment, the intern will design and deliver personalized communication with likely donors. This is important so that when the annual fund solicitation is extended to the donor, it isn’t the only time they have heard from an ILR AA&amp;D staff person in a personalized way. These efforts generate helpful feedback and reveal interests previously unknown to the AA&amp;D program. The student would be trained on basic indicators of capacity and inclination and invited to present names on a bi-weekly basis that might be deserving of ongoing higher level interaction. Communication for the high potential annual fund donor segment could include, but is not limited to, current updates, interesting research, pictures or videos of spaces, classes, interesting things other alumni have done, other alumni gifts and exciting developments at ILR. The intern will work in concert with Haley and her existing plans for high touch outreach to these groups. A successful intern will also work hard to integrate this messaging into the social media strategy and help increase traffic to these sites. This last task is particularly important so that when the internship ends, there will be a lasting and measurable impact on alumni engagement. The intern will also be involved in providing engaging and informative content to social media appropriate to raise friends and eventual annual supporters. The intern will assist in designing the year-end appeal. Deliverables: The intern will document their general activities in a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) which may be used in the future for other student workers or interns. In addition, they will keep an electronic folder of all communications and create a document tracking meaningful interactions with prospective annual fund donors. The year-end appeal will reflect the inputs of the intern. Stewardship Project Approximate intern time commitment (10hrs/week)The intern will assist Haley Singer in organizing the master database of all of our restricted gifts &amp; endowments. He/she will track and enter important stewardship instructions like 1) stewarding office (ILRAA&amp;D, OCS, Donor relations, etc) 2) staff responsible for stewardship 2) procedure 3) examples of previous stewardship. For racked prospects (at a minimum) the intern will also ensure that pertinent stewardship information is entered into PeopleSoft. For funds that are in need of stewardship, the intern will assess what kind of stewardship may be needed based on the nature of the gift (space, deans discretionary/excellence funds, professorship, research fund, etc) and the characteristics of the donor or surviving family members, and will make recommendations. The intern will also create some letter templates for common categories such as professorships, dean’s excellence funds, international travel grants, etc, and use them to write letters for those funds this year. It is expected that the intern will use familiar and researched experiences with faculty, programs, classes etc., when appropriate and work with other students to create testimonials and other media that can be included in stewardship communications. The objective would be to design tailored communication that reaches beyond what is achievable by mass communication. It is our belief that behind many of these under-stewarded funds are donors who would be more engaged if they knew how much their gifts meant to the School. This activity will help satisfy annual mandatory stewardship requirements for donors with 100K giving and above, but will also be helpful in creating a repeatable plan for broad based stewardship in ILR overall. Deliverables: Master database of stewardship tracking, standard operating procedure discussing how stewardship was designed, prioritized and delivered, and an electronic collection of templates and actual communications sent. MILR Fellowship Campaign (Ongoing as needed/available)If the intern has the time, he/she could assist with the MILR Fellowship campaign. Activities would be similar to the Annual Fund project with respect to segmentation and personalizing asks via mass outreach. In addition, the intern would help facilitate peer-to-peer fundraising via social media. <br>\r\n\t\t<strong>Minimum qualifications: </strong>Required: Junior or Senior ILR student with a demonstrated interest in non-profit management and development.<br>\r\n\t\t<strong>Number of opportunities: </strong>1<br>\r\n\t\t<strong>Compensation: </strong>$15/hr<br>\r\n\t\t<strong>Begin and end dates: </strong>Entire winter break is possible with the exception of the December university holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<hr size=\"1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wispOpp\">\r\n\t<h4>Epstein Becker Green</h4>\r\n\r\n\t<p class=\"desc\">Epstein Becker Green is a law firm representing employers.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h2>BSILR'16</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I worked at the American Federation of Teachers in Washington DC for four months during my Junior year. The experience of working at an activist labor union was incredible. I've spent a lot of time studying the labor movement at the ILR School, but the AFT gave me the chance to understand the challenges confronting the labor movement from a new and hands-on perspective. Also, at AFT I used data analysis skills that I learned in my ILR statistics courses and in labor market research I conducted with ILR faculty. This nexus of academic skills and professional union work defined my experience at AFT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR credit internship program, which combined full-time work plus one academic class, gave me the opportunity to explore and develop professionally. I made many connections with labor leaders and activists during my internship. Many of these connections are through AFT, and others are through events, panels, and parties I attended while in Washington DC.&nbsp; I didn't feel like these connections were fostered through forced networking. Instead, I engaged with the people I was working with on a deep level about complex issues that confront the labor movement, society, and our world. Working closely with people about problems you are passionate about solving is the best way to really build a powerful and good network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My time in DC and at AFT also allowed for great personal development. The passion and dedication of the activists and thinkers I met at AFT and in DC inspired me to engage in on-campus student activism. I learned that sitting and waiting for lawmakers, administrators, or even union leaders to act will not work. Real social change requires direct organization, education, and action. My time in DC helped me understand strategies and ideas that I now use in my life to advocate for social justice and change the environment around me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, I am very thankful that the&nbsp;Edward Gray Memorial Credit Internship&nbsp;helped support and assist me in these accomplishments. When I received the award, I really felt that other advocates for working class and poor people were interested in my work and in the work of other undergraduates in the activist labor movement.</p>\r\n",

    "text_paragraph_values": "<h2>New Students: Welcome to the ILR School</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR faculty and staff are actively preparing for your arrival in August, and we are all excited about working with you in your upcoming years with us. Whether you are a first-year or transfer student there is a wealth of available information to make your orientation to ILR and Cornell University as easy as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some things you will need to take action on in the coming weeks. We encourage you to pay close attention to the information on the rest of this page, explore the links provided, and become acquainted with the information available to you on the <a href=\"/node/5461\">ILR Office of Student Services (OSS) website</a>. Following the suggested procedures will ensure that you are well prepared for your academic transition in the fall. You will also receive a postal mailing and email from the ILR Office of Student Services in mid-June, which will provide school specific orientation activities you will need to plan on attending upon your arrival in August.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>First-Year Students</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Activate your Cornell NetID</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ccengagement.cornell.edu/\">Campus &amp; Community Engagement</a> and <a href=\"http://prelim.ccengagement.cornell.edu/new-student-programs/orientation\">New Student Programs</a> websites are a good place to start looking at things you need to accomplish before your arrival on campus. Cornell will get your NetID and activation code to you after receiving your response to admission coupon and deposit. You are expected to activate your NetID immediately. <a href=\"http://newstudents.cornell.edu/fall-2015/first-year/netid-email\">For more information, visit NetID &amp; E-mail</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will need your NetID to login for course enrollment, First-Year Writing Seminar balloting, swim test sign-up, and course add/drop. These things are important, so get your NetID activated and memorized as soon as you can!</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Become Familiar with the ILR Curriculum Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Your ILR program of study is very unique. All freshmen will have the opportunity to request some courses during the fall semester pre-enrollment period — July 10-18. However, the ILR Registrar will automatically \"block- schedule\" you for some of the required courses that need to be taken in the first semester of study-freshman year. Most first-year students will be scheduled for ILRID 1500, Economics 1110, ILRLR 1100 or ILROB 1200. Half of the first-year class will take either OB or LR in the fall semester, and take the other in the spring semester. The complete ILR undergraduate curriculum is available at the <a href=\"/node/5901\">curriculum website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AP and IB courses may be able to satisfy some curriculum requirements, depending on your score. You can see specifics on qualifying scores at <a href=\"http://courses.cornell.edu/\">Cornell's Courses of Study web site</a>. Official AP and IB scores and final transcripts should be sent to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, if you have not already done so. A maximum of 12 credits of Advanced Placement work may be used for Cornell credit. Any additional AP course work can only be used for course placement purposes. Advanced Placement credit may not be used to accelerate graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that the ILR School has a residency requirement. The ILR Faculty believe that full-time study for a defined period best promotes intellectual development and best prepares students for citizenship and careers. Consequently, undergraduates must complete eight semesters of full-time study, which can include work done while on an approved credit internship or study abroad program, in order to meet your degree requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will not be able to drop any of the block-scheduled courses without approval of an advisor in OSS. Some of you may have some space in your schedule that will allow you to add a distribution course (Western Intellectual Tradition, Science and Technology, or Cultural Perspectives) or a free elective. You will be able to add a course through Student Center by following the steps on the <a href=\"https://newstudents.cornell.edu/fall-2015/first-year/course-enrollment/creating-your-schedule\">Creating Your Schedule web page</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, you can check out what your options may be at the ILR curriculum link above.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>First-Year Writing Seminars</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornell students are required to complete at least 6 credits (2 courses) of written expression in the first two semesters at the University. The First-Year Writing Seminar course enrollment is through an electronic ballot process. You should refer to the <a href=\"http://www.arts.cornell.edu/knight_institute/fws/\">Knight Writing Institute website</a> for more information on First-Year Writing Seminar enrollment. ILR Faculty policy allows students to meet one of the required first-year writing courses with AP credit for English Language or Literature with a score of 4 or 5. An IB English Literature score of 7 or above can also serve to meet one of the first-year writing courses. Those scores should be submitted directly to the Admissions Processing Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Physical Education Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Cornell requires students to complete two semesters of Physical Education and a Swim Test. If you can swim, you will complete the test during Orientation week and may enroll in any physical education course. If you cannot swim, or do not feel confident about your swimming skills, enroll in Beginning Swim (PE 1100) during your course enrollment period. More information can be found at the <a href=\"http://pe.cornell.edu/requirements\">Physical Education website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Check your Course Enrollment</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>August 15: Sign in to Student Essentials to view your schedule and verify your registration status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will be able to view your First-Year Writing Seminar enrollment and other courses. You will also be able to verify that you have no holds that prevent your University registration.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Transfer Students Only</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You will need to follow the procedures listed above regarding activation of your NetID and familiarizing yourself with the ILR curriculum requirements, but in most cases, you will not be facing the need to register for a first-year writing seminar or PE courses. Transfer students are not required to take a swim test at Cornell.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Course Registration</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The courses you take in the fall semester and in the coming semesters depend to a great extent upon an evaluation of your final transcript from the school(s) that you have attended. Most of your first semester courses will be required and you will be automatically \"block-enrolled\" by the ILR Registrar in these classes. If you have space available for elective courses, you will be able to register for them in the regular registration period in August. You will not be able to drop any of the \"blocked\" courses without discussion and approval from one of the advisors in the Office of Student Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR School residency requirement stipulates that those who enter the school as transfer students will be required to complete four to six semesters of full-time study. A maximum of 12 credits of Advanced Placement work may be used for Cornell credit. Any additional AP course work can only be used for course placement purposes. Advanced Placement credit may not be used to accelerate graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Official AP or IB test scores and final transcripts should be sent to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center if you have not already done so. Submitted transcripts will be evaluated to determine which courses you need not take here because you have already had their content, and to indicate those that must still be taken. If you wish to substitute additional courses for ILR requirements, we will need official information regarding the content of those courses. Please email course descriptions to <a href=\"mailto:ilr_registrar@cornell.edu\">ilr_registrar@cornell.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transfer to a new school can be tumultuous, and we recognize that reality. We will do everything we can to make the transition as easy as possible for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>All New Students</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your academic advisors are those of us in the ILR Office of Student Services. We are Kevin Harris, Jenn Weidner and Cornell Woodson. Faculty advisors and peer mentors who have experience working with first-year and transfer students will be assigned to you as well. You will hear from your peer mentor over the summer. Once the semester begins, you may meet with your faculty advisor and peer mentor in group and individual gatherings. You are about to embark on a tremendous academic journey at an institution that offers you limitless opportunities for intellectual, social, recreational, and personal development. We are dedicated to helping you achieve goals you may want to reach in each of those areas. Please don't hesitate to contact any one of us in the ILR Office of Student Services if you have questions over the summer. We can be reached at (607) 255-2223, <a href=\"mailto:ilr_registrar@cornell.edu\">ilr_registrar@cornell.edu</a> or <a href=\"mailto:ilr_oss@cornell.edu\">ilr_oss@cornell.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can't wait to meet you!</p>\r\n",

Eight ILR elective credits are awarded on an S/U basis for approximately 30 hours a week devoted to the internship assignment. An additional 4 hours of ILR elective credit will be awarded for a project completed under the direction of an ILR faculty member. The project, which is usually based on the internship assignment, will be graded on an A-F basis. Finally, you are required to take a 4-credit ILR seminar which is offered in both locations and meets once a week, bringing the semester's credit load to 16 hours. You will be considered a full-time student for financial aid purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Other Locations Outside Ithaca</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You may also undertake internships at approved sites outside of Ithaca, in locations other than New York City or Washington, D.C. As outlined above, eight credits will be awarded on an S/U basis for the internship assignment and 4 credits for the project completed under the guidance of the ILR faculty sponsor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some students register for a course at a nearby college or university and gain approval to transfer those credits. Students should discuss any transfer course with Ms. Jenn Weidner before leaving campus. All students are considered full-time for financial aid purposes at 12 credits, therefore, additional course work is not required. Student may also choose to complete an independent study for additional credit. Students must meet certain eligibility requirements and independent study proposals must be approved by the Office of Student Services.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"/node/6211\">Learn more about independent study options</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>International Locations</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR Credit Internship Program has expanded internship opportunities to numerous international locations. Internships span the broad reach of the ILR field with opportunities in corporate HR, trade unions, and social justice/non profits. We are also happy to work with individual students to arrange appropriate international placements of the student's choice. As outlined above, eight credits will be awarded on an S/U basis for the internship assignment and 4 credits for the project completed under the guidance of the ILR faculty sponsor. All students pursuing international internships will receive a minimum of 12 credits and will be considered full-time for financial aid purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Ithaca Area</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, you may undertake internships under appropriate faculty supervision at approved sites in the Ithaca area, although only four credits of independent study can be earned through such an arrangement. Interns will devote no more than 12 hours a week to the internship assignment. <strong>Please note, if you elect to pursue a 4-credit internship, you will not be eligible to pursue a full-semester credit internship at a later date.</strong></p>\r\n",

The internship process is generally not completed by the time of pre-registration (roughly the beginning of November for the Spring term and the beginning of April for the Fall term) and the possibility always exists that a student's plan to undertake an internship will not work out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Registration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If the internship does become a reality, the Registrar of the ILR School will register all interns for internship credit and, for those located in Washington, D.C. and New York City, the ILR course offered in each location. Students should make certain that the ILR Registrar is aware of any non-Cornell courses they are planning to take in order to ensure that the credit received is transferable.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pre-enrollment While Off-Campus</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To pre-enroll for the semester following their credit internship, students participating in the ILR Credit Internship Program pre-enroll just as they would if they were on campus. As pre-registration approaches, students will receive an email from the Office of Student Services that includes official pre-enrollment dates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions or problems you must contact Jenn Weidner <a href=\"mailto:jlw297@cornell.edu\">jlw297@cornell.edu</a> <strong>prior</strong> to your pre-registration date to ensure that you get the courses you need.&nbsp; Late inquiries or problems may not be cleared up in time to guarantee you will get your first choice for classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit the Cornell website for complete <a href=\"http://www.cornell.edu/academics/courses.cfm\">course listings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not ask anyone else to pre-register for you.&nbsp; This is a violation of the Cornell Code of Conduct and you could be referred to the Judicial Office for disciplinary action.</p>\r\n",

Since acceptance of the transfer credit may affect your plans for completing requirements for graduation, it is important that you talk with an advisor in the <a href=\"/node/5131\">Office of Student Services</a> before you commit to an internship in order to determine whether or not the transfer credit is likely to be accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students desiring ILR credit, rather than general elective credit, will find the process somewhat more complicated since the approval of the appropriate department chairperson is required. Before taking the course, check by telephone with the appropriate department chairman or the program director. After the official transcript is received by the ILR Registrar, the student should make an appointment with the chairperson of the department involved and be ready to provide a course syllabus or reading list, course description, and samples of work completed (i.e., exam booklets or papers). The chairperson will evaluate these materials and decide whether or not to grant ILR credit. This procedure applies to all non-ILR courses.</p>\r\n",

FVAP encourages the use of the Federal Post Card Application (FPCA) to start the absentee voting process as it is standardized for use across all States and will extend your eligibility to receive a ballot for all Federal elections for at least one calendar year. The FPCA acts as both a registration and absentee ballot request form. FVAP encourages overseas citizen voters to submit a new FPCA every year and when they move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It only takes a few quick steps to make sure your vote is counted no matter where you are in the world. The FPCA can be easily completed by using the <a href=\"http://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/registration-ballots\">FPCA online assistant</a>, filling out the <a href=\"http://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca2013.pdf\">PDF</a> or picking up a hardcopy version from your nearest&nbsp;U.S. embassy or consulate location.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Complete and sign the FPCA using your State's instructions.

From alumni networking to zipline and hiking activities, Barry quickly acclimated to the new environment, both physically, and academically. Barry says, “ILR showers you with resources and attention but they also allow for the independence needed to learn about oneself and about Cornell.” He is grateful for the opportunity to take classes over the summer so he can study abroad in Singapore and work at American Express during the academic year.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jaelle Sanon</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"55391\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"height\":2448,\"width\":1836,\"style\":\"float: left; height: 253px; width: 190px; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10px;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]] My name is Jaelle Sanon and I am a senior in ILR and attended PSP in 2015. I was born and partly raised in Jacmel, Haiti before moving to Boston, MA in 2005. I graduated from the John D. O'Bryant School of Math and Science. As a high school senior, I was elated to have been accepted to Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations but was saddened by the fact that I had to attend the Pre-Freshman Program as I was hoping to spend the last summer before college at home hanging out with friends and family. Initially, I questioned whether or not I even deserved to be a Cornellian due to the fact that I had to attend PSP. However, I knew that Cornell was the place for me and decided to enroll in PSP and that was the best decision I have made in my academic career. PSP created a place where I made genuine friendships that I will carry with me post-Cornell (Post-Graduation, I will be moving to New York City with one my PSP friends!). It gave me a view of Cornell's academic rigor before the fall semester and provided resources to help my academic success!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PSP also helped me establish connections with ILR offices such as the International Programs Office and Office of Student Services. Finally, PSP showed me the opportunities that ILR has to offer such as Credit Internship, Study Abroad and Gloabl Service Learning Programs. With those connections in mind, I was able to participate in ILR GSL's India 2017 Cohort where I worked on a Human Resources Management project at an NGO. I also obtained my first corporate internship experience at JPMorgan Chase where I worked on employee development program through JPMC's Autism at Work program. Finally, I was able to use On-Campus Recruitment to work at Deutsche Bank as a summer Human Resources Analyst and will return in July as a full-time employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Daniel Muniz-Garcia</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"55386\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"height\":242,\"width\":190,\"style\":\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 0;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]Daniel Muniz-Garcia graduated from the ILR School in 2016. He is originally from Azusa, CA and attended Rialto High School. Daniel was excited to attend the PSP program and says, “I would have attended even if I wasn’t required.” He was really looking forward to starting a new adventure, but also a bit scared for the coming challenges of attending college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Daniel’s favorite part of the program is meeting people from different places and backgrounds. He said, “I had a genuine blast! The program provided me with the social and academic tools to take on the rigorous Cornell curriculum.” Daniel felt the small size of the ILR PSP cohort allowed for personal interactions with faculty, other ILR students, and ILR offices. He ends by saying, “Cornell Woodson is also the homie, so you’ll have a blast under his guidance.”</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Jeffrey J.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"58506\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"height\":1504,\"width\":1661,\"style\":\"height: 172px; width: 190px; float: left; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10px;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]] Jeffrey J. graduated from the ILR School in 2015 and graduated with a Masters of Public Administration from Cornell University. Originally from Chicago, he attended Northside College Prep High School. When Jeffrey first got his letter about attending PSP, he was excited but was not sure what to expect. He writes, \"PSP was a great opportunity to get more comfortable with the environment at Cornell and have a productive summer after high school.\" Jeffrey felt that the best part of PSP were the connections he made with the other participants and the ability to acclimate to the academic rigor of Cornell. While here for the summer, he learned about the resources Cornell and ILR offer to support students. Jeffrey was also able to better understand the ILR curriculum and develop some of his interests early on. Overall, he felt more prepared for his first year at Cornell and was glad he chose to participate in PSP.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thaddeus Talbot</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"58511\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"field_deltas\":{\"4\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"height\":1050,\"width\":850,\"style\":\"height: 235px; width: 190px; float: left; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10px;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"4\"}}]] Thaddeus Talbot graduated from the ILR School in 2015. Originally from Brooklyn, NY, he attended James Madison High School. Thaddeus chose to participate in the PSP program even though he was not required to attend, which speaks volumes to the program's benefits. He writes, \"I chose PSP because.... I thought [it] would be a great place where I could grow my intellectual and social independence while enjoying a summer in a new environment.\" Thaddeus was eager to get out of the city and experience something new and embrace his new found independence. According to Thaddeus, some of the best parts of PSP was getting together with the other students to talk about classes and the summer activities. He said, \"it was laid back and a nice break from class.\" PSP helped him transition from his high school mentality like calling his teachers professor instead of Mr. or Mrs., walking to classes that were located in different buildings instead of down the hall, and managing his own time and finances. Thaddeus feels that PSP helped him get acquainted with the campus, boost his confidence, and included the added bonus of earning credit. One thing Thaddeus wants future PSP participants to know is that, \"Some of my best friends are folks I spent a lot of time with in PSP. At the same time, once the school year starts do not overlook the importance of branching out and making new friends. Welcome them into your cohort so that your network and exposure to varying opinions expands.\"</p>\r\n\r\n",

If you are traveling from other locations, you will be fully reimbursed for travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why was I invited to attend PSP?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students are invited based on their high school experiences, geographic location, and personal backgrounds. Each year, the ILR Admissions Committee is given a set number of spaces for this fully-funded summer experience and selects students who they believe will benefit from and appreciate the many ways PSP assists with the transition to college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why am I required to attend PSP?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few common reasons ILR requires students to attend PSP:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>We feel that an early start could help ensure a smooth transition from high school to college given aspects of your academic record. This can include fluctuations in performance throughout HS, lower grades in certain ILR-relevant areas, etc.</li>\r\n\t<li>Your current geographic location is different from that of Ithaca, NY and we believe a summer in Ithaca is the perfect way to acclimate yourself to this new environment.</li>\r\n\t<li>You are a member of the Educational Opportunity Program.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should I bring with me to PSP?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your official PSP welcome packet will include suggested items that you might consider bringing with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What will be expected of me during PSP?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During PSP, you will be expected to attend all classes, activities and meetings. While on campus, you will be expected to follow all Cornell rules and standards of behavior.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How will the program help me?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This program will allow you to earn credit toward your ILR degree, make new friends, meet your advisors, and learn your way around the campus and Ithaca community before other new students arrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if I need to work this summer?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Admissions Committee has required you to attend PSP, work is not reason enough to be excused from attending, as we believe this experience will play an important role in your acclimation to and success at Cornell. We will work with the Office of Financial Aid to cover the contributions expected from summer work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What if the PSP dates conflict with my graduation and prom?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of a conflict, while you will be allowed to attend both of these events, it will be your responsibility to obtain any information from the classes you miss while you are away. PSP will <em>only</em> pay for your transportation to attend graduation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What happens if I do not attend PSP or do not successfully complete the program?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are required to attend PSP, but choose not to, or if you are required or invited, and begin the program, but do not complete it, you will NOT be permitted to attend Cornell University in the fall. There are NO exceptions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who can I contact for more information now and during this summer?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please contact the ILR Office of Student Services if you have anyquestions (607-255-2223 or <a href=\"mailto:ilr_oss@cornell.edu\">ilr_oss@cornell.edu</a>).</p>\r\n",

Referral to the appropriate team, each staffed by a deep bench of lawyers, allows for maximum effectiveness in client service.

ILR's curriculum spans six academic departments and encompasses the interdisciplinary, social sciences-based field of workplace studies. ILR undergraduate students are leaders and self-starters, and our advanced degree programs are the best in the world. At ILR, you recruit from a diverse group of approximately 1000 undergraduates and 250 graduate students to be future leaders in your workplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ILR prides itself on the ethnic, racial and geographic diversity of its students and is responsive to the social, academic, and cultural needs of students from diverse backgrounds. ILR students hail from all corners of the country and world. For information on current class year demographics, please contact our Director, Regina Duffey Moravek, at (607) 255-7816.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/degree-programs/undergraduate-degree-programs\">View specific information about the BSILR curriculum.</a><br>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/academics/degree-programs/graduate-degree-programs\">View more information about our graduate degree programs and curriculum.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recruit Current Students</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Employers interested in hiring ILR students </strong>are expected to adhere to Cornell Career Service's <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/employers/hiring_students/recruiting/policies.cfm\">recruiting policies</a>&nbsp; for internship/full-time recruiting, and can recruit in the following ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"line-height: 20.0063px;\">Summer Internships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: freight-sans-pro-n4, freight-sans-pro, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; color: rgb(47, 47, 47); margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.42105em; line-height: 27px; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);\">Many employers ask if they are legally required to pay students enrolled in an internship. The answer to that question depends on whether or not the student is considered an employee subject to the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA requires employers to pay all employees at the rate of not less than current minimum wage. The Department of Labor (DOL) has developed criteria to assist employers in identifying when a student is&nbsp;<strong style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><em style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">not</em></strong>&nbsp;considered an employee within the meaning of the FLSA:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"box-sizing: border-box; padding-left: 2em; line-height: 30.7427px; color: rgb(47, 47, 47); font-family: freight-sans-pro-n4, freight-sans-pro, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);\">\r\n\t<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style: decimal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42105em; background: none;\">\r\n\t\t<p>The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocation school.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style: decimal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42105em; background: none;\">\r\n\t\t<p>The training is for the benefit of the trainees or students.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style: decimal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42105em; background: none;\">\r\n\t\t<p>The trainees or students do not displace regular employees, but work under their close observation.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style: decimal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42105em; background: none;\">\r\n\t\t<p>The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees or students, and on occasion the employer's operations may actually be impeded.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style: decimal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42105em; background: none;\">\r\n\t\t<p>The trainees or students are not necessarily entitled to a job at the conclusion of the training period.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style: decimal; font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.42105em; background: none;\">\r\n\t\t<p>The employer and the trainees or students understand that the trainees or students are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-family: freight-sans-pro-n4, freight-sans-pro, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; color: rgb(47, 47, 47); margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.42105em; line-height: 27px; background-color: rgb(250, 250, 250);\">A student not meeting all of the above criteria will in fact be considered an employee covered by the FLSA and therefore the employer is legally obligated to provide compensation for his or her services. As with all matters requiring legal interpretation, it is always wise for employers to work closely with their own legal department to ensure compliance with federal and applicable state laws.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>On-Campus Recruiting</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The ILR Office of Career Services hosts an active on-campus recruiting program managed through <a href=\"https://cornell.joinhandshake.com/\">Handshake</a>.

    "text_paragraph_values": "<p><strong>Leave of Absence</strong><br>\r\n\tIn rare circumstances, ILR graduate students may find it necessary to postpone their studies for a while. Reasons to take a leave of absence may include: personal or family health circumstances, financial difficulties, or professional changes. A Leave of Absence (LOA) is requested if/when you must leave the University and plan to return at a later time to resume your program of study. A leave is typically granted for people who are in good academic standing, for one semester. A request for extension of the leave for an additional semester should be provided before the end of the first semester of leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leaves of absence typically last for at least six months and are not generally granted for more than two years. A leave of absence granted during the semester goes into effect based on the last day a student attends classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Leave of Absence requested before the beginning of the 8th week in the semester carries two implications:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>that the student on Leave may request return in the next semester</li>\r\n\t<li>that there will be no record of classes and grades for the semester</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>After the beginning of the 8th week, the notation \"W\" will be entered for the courses in which a student is registered, and the student may not expect to return to classes until an entire semester has elapsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personal (Voluntary) Leave</strong><br>\r\n\tMay be taken if a student is in good academic standing and takes the leave for the up-coming semester or within the first 7 weeks of the current semester. Personal (voluntary) leave must be requested in writing to the ILR Graduate Office for a specified period of time. Individual circumstances will determine what kind of leave a student may take (personal or health related). Students will receive written confirmation of their leave from the ILR Registrar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students may return from a personal leave whenever they wish (typically within two years). Exceptions may be granted given individual circumstances. This must be requested in writing by the student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Health Leave</strong><br>\r\n\tA health leave may be taken if a student consults with University Health Services (Gannett) about this option; the ILR School will grant and readmit a student from a medical leave only upon the recommendation of Gannett. Please see <a href=\"https://www.gannett.cornell.edu/services/leaveofabsence.cfm\">https://www.gannett.cornell.edu/services/leaveofabsence.cfm</a> if you are seeking a Health Leave of Absence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a student is taking a leave for emotional or psychological reasons, it will usually be for at least six months. Gannet Counseling and Psychological Services will devise a plan with the student to be undertaken while on health leave. Therapy, work, and academic endeavors may be part of the plan. The ILR School will determine what academic endeavors a student may be required to meet while on health leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a student taking a health leave is on Academic Warning, the ILR School may stipulate additional conditions for the leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Withdrawal</strong><br>\r\n\tIf, in mid-semester, a student decides to withdraw from Cornell University, with no intention of returning, they must submit a letter to the Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), stating their intention to withdraw. This letter should be on file prior to their departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a student requests a Leave of Absence or withdraws, it is their responsibility to contact the following offices prior to leaving to find out about possible implications of doing so:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"mailto:ilrgradprograms@cornell.edu\">ILR Graduate Programs Office</a>, 218 Ives Hall</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.gannett.cornell.edu/\">Gannett Health Services</a> (if the leave is health related)<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-5155</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.bursar.cornell.edu/\">Bursar's Office</a>, 260 Day Hall<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-6413</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://finaid.cornell.edu/\">Financial Aid Office</a>, 203 Day Hall<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-5145</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://campuslife.cornell.edu/dining/dining.asp?catID=162\">Cornell Dining</a>, 206 Robert Purcell (if you have a dining plan)<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-8582</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://housing.cornell.edu/\">Residence Life</a>, 119 Robert Purcell (if you live in University housing)<br>\r\n\t\t(607) 255-5511</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Support and Additional Resources</strong><br>\r\n\tThe Graduate Office is here to support your personal and academic success.

ILR partners with <a href=\"http://thriive.org/\">Thriive</a>, a global non-profit organization, whose goal is to help small and medium sized businesses in developing markets. The businesses that receive assistance from Thriive pay-it-forward to their local communities by creating new jobs, offering job training, and/or providing products and services to others in need. Students who participate in this program will work with students from <a href=\"http://www.uam.edu.ni/\">The American University in Managua (UAM)</a> to provide training and solutions in Human Resource Management to Thriive businesses. This program will be overseen by Lisa Nishii and Becky Paluch of the ILR HR Department.</div>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><u>Information Session</u></strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">Thursday, Aug 31, 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">4:30 PM in 116 Ives Hall</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">Program leaders will be at the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">For questions contact Donna Ramil at <a href=\"mailto:dmr47@cornell.edu\">dmr47@cornell.edu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Potential projects for this class will involve using a framework to create a presentation to be delivered to Thriive businesses on HR Management.

This class is designed to give students an opportunity to leverage their Human Resource management skills while developing new ones in an exciting and challenging international environment.&nbsp; In this course, students will learn about HR issues and topics that entrepreneurs in developing markets are facing and are provided with knowledge and skills needed to address these challenges. In addition, students will work as consultants in Nicaragua on a project which addresses actual HR issues occurring in small- and medium-sized businesses in the country.&nbsp; These projects will challenge students to employ their HR knowledge to develop and implement a strategy for an assigned project in a manner that satisfies the host-country partners and&nbsp;meets course requirements. The required assignments for this course present students with new challenges, such as language and cultural barriers and high levels of ambiguity and uncertainty. Accordingly, an important component of the experience is the pre-trip training, during which students prepare for these challenges with the help of ILR faculty and staff.&nbsp; The primary goal of this course is to provide students with a human resources-focused learning experience that will be remembered as one of the most meaningful and important experiences developing students both personally and professionally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students will also be required to attend pre-departure meetings, beginning in late-October (the meetings will be planned around students’ schedules).&nbsp;&nbsp; The meetings will cover a mix of topics to prepare students personally and culturally for their in-country experience including travel logistics, risk management, health &amp; safety, introduction to Nicaraguan history and culture, and language preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spring 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students will be required to take the post-course <strong>ILRHR 4697</strong> (1 credit)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Course Description:</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course is a continuation of <strong>ILRHR 4687</strong> and builds upon the purpose and goals established in the prior semester. As such, this course is designed to solidify the knowledge and skills students acquire in addressing human resource challenges faced by entrepreneurs in developing markets both from class work and experiences in the field. Students will participate in activities to reflect on and share experiences they faced including solving HR issues that confronted their assigned business partners, addressing language or cultural barriers which arose while working in teams, and learning from the lessons gained in overcoming these challenges. This course requires a final project encompassing the skills and knowledge gained from experiences with this class. Participation in ILRHR 4687 is required and entry into the class is subject to instructor approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Details about the <em>Nicaragua Winter Break Program</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight ILR students will be selected for the winter break program.</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel would occur from January 6-16, 2018 (approximate, the exact dates will be confirmed).

The FLSA requires employers to pay all employees at the rate of not less than current minimum wage. The Department of Labor (DOL) has developed <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs71.htm\">criteria</a> to assist employers in identifying when a student is&nbsp;<strong><em>not</em></strong>&nbsp;considered an employee within the meaning of the FLSA. A student not meeting the criteria will in fact be considered an employee covered by the FLSA and therefore the employer is legally obligated to provide compensation for his or her services. As with all matters requiring legal interpretation, it is always wise for employers to work closely with their own legal department to ensure compliance with federal and applicable state laws.</p>\r\n",

When attending a career fair focused on labor, advocacy, or nonprofits, if you do not have work or volunteer experience in related areas, consider adding an objective to state your interest. If you haven’t already done so, get your résumé critiqued by staff in ILR Career Services; come to walk-in hours or schedule an appointment by stopping by 201 Ives or calling 607-255-7816.&nbsp; Bring 15-20 copies with you to the fair, preferably on résumé paper.

Review the tips below and contact us with any questions. If you have questions about your career development, or need help creating a job/internship search strategy, <a href=\"https://cornell1.force.com/cu/s/appointments\">schedule remote (Zoom) appointments</a> with OCS advisors (be sure to note that you are away and need to conduct the appointment via Zoom or phone).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>ON-CAMPUS RECRUITING (OCR) POSTINGS IN HANDSHAKE</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Complete Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/handshake.cfm\">Watch the On-Campus Recruiting Tutorial</a> (allow 3 business days for processing) to be able to view/access OCR postings.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Add “<strong>STUDYING OFF CAMPUS – SPRING 2020</strong>” to your resume.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Review the <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/policies.cfm\">rights and responsibilities</a> by which Cornell expects you to participate in OCR.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Begin Applying</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Review postings carefully and craft applications only to those that interest you.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Contact recruiters informing them you are away from campus. Attach your materials for convenience.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Follow all application instructions. If employers direct you to an in-house system, you must also apply there by the deadline for the posting.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Avoid waiting until the deadline; some employers review applications on a rolling basis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OCR Interviews</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>If selected as a Primary or Alternate candidate in Handshake, contact the employer to ask the employer if they are able/willing to arrange a virtual interview outside the on-campus interview schedule (recommended) to remain compliant with Cornell Career Services’ <a href=\"http://www.career.cornell.edu/students/jobs/recruiting/policies.cfm\">On-Campus Recruiting Policy</a>.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Sign up for an interview slot in Handshake ONLY IF the employer tells you they intend to conduct a virtual interview as part of the on-campus visit.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>If you need contact information for an employer, email <a href=\"mailto:ilrcareerrecruiting@cornell.edu\">ilrcareerrecruiting@cornell.edu</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>OFF-CAMPUS JOB/INTERNSHIP POSTINGS </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore Handshake, but also sites like <a href=\"www.indeed.com\">Indeed.com</a>, <a href=\"www.Idealist.org\">Idealist.org</a> (specifically for non-profits), and industry-specific search sites (like <a href=\"www.USAJobs.gov\">USAJobs.gov</a>). Follow the instructions on the posting on how to apply. Some will accept applications through the search sites while others will direct you to their websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure your application materials indicate clearly ways to contact you while you are away from campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>RESUME TIPS</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>For study abroad, UCD, LSE, and other academic exchange programs, add the abroad experience under the “education” section, as a separate entry below Cornell.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Credit interns: Add it as either under Relevant Experience, Experience, or Internship Experience, with bullets outlining the details and the transferable skills.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>List only addresses and contact info where you may be reached. For example, if you are abroad, and are not using your domestic phone number, then don’t list it.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>If including address, use your temporary address, if desired. It helps remind readers that you are away from campus.<br>\r\n    &nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Include any Skype or other video chat account name and/or an international cell phone number as part of your contact information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Find <a href=\"http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/career-path/write-resume-or-cover-letter\">additional resume tips</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>COMPOSE STRONG COVER LETTERS </strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First paragraph should indicate that you are away from campus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For On-Campus Recruiting postings in Handshake, be clear that because you are unable to interview on site and if selected, hope to make alternate arrangements for an interview. Indicate if you are in driving distance and are willing to come to Ithaca for the interview date, assuming your current credit intern sponsor is okay with it (ask first)!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read about how to <a>write effective cover letters</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
