# Salesforce Mapped Object Protection

This module currently protects all mapped fields on nodes that have been mapped to SalesForce.

## Roadmap

- Include support for additional entities (commerce products, users, etc.).
- Consider creating an interface with checkboxes for each SalesForce mapping definition to protect the fields. Alternatively, mapped fields themselves could be checked individually.
