# Collection Content Permissions

Adds some useful permissions to collected content for Collection owners.

- Override published option for canonical content in editable collections
- Edit any canonical content in editable collections
- View any unpublished canonical content in editable collections

## Known issues

- A Collection owner can add content (e.g. a node) which they cannot edit to a Collection that they _can_ edit. If they add the collection item as canonical and they have the 'Edit any canonical content in editable collections' permission, they will now have edit access to the content.
