# Collection request

Allows users to request that content items be added to a collection, e.g. a cross post.

## Roadmap

- Add and enforce two new permissions
  - `request any content in collections`
  - `request own content in collections`
- Optionally:
  - `request {entity_type_id}:{entity_bundle} content in collections`
- Add an `allows_requests` (or similar) property to Collections
