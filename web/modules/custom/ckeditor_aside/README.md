# CKEditor Aside

Adds a button to place paragraphs and other blocks inside an `<aside>` element.

## Usage

Enable this module.

Configure a text format (`/admin/config/content/formats`) and edit the *Toolbar configuration* to include the 'Aside' button.

## Notes

This module is experimental. If we do further work, we should figure out how to treat `aside` elements like other blocks in the editor, especially in relation to the [`magicline` plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/magicline.html).
